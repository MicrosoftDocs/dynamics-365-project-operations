1. Open the **Feature management** workspace.
2. Find and select **Enable (India) GST/TDS-TCS tax support for Project Integration Journal feature** in the list.
3. Select **Enable**.

For tax setup, the required configuration version is **85.157.303**.

## Enable GST/TDS-TCS taxes in Integration journals

Project Operations Integration journals are created by using the **Import from staging table** periodic process. You can run this process in Dynamics 365 Finance by going to **Project management and accounting** \> **Periodic** \> **Project Operations Integration** \> **Import from staging table**.

When this feature is enabled, you can calculate Indian taxes and adjust accounting attributes for Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Tax Deducted at Sourceâ€“Tax Collected at Source (TDS-TCS) transactions in project integration journals. These journals help you use revenue recognition with taxes in the books of accounts. They also let you generate customer tax documents and legally compliant tax reports, such as GSTR-1, GSTR-2, and the GST offline tool.

India-specific tax information is added to the following processes:

- Dynamics 365 Finance:

    - Hour, Fee, Item, and Expense journals
    - Integration journals
    - Project invoice proposals

- Dataverse:

    - Invoice corrections
    - Project invoice proposals

Default tax information and TDS/TCS groups are included in the Hour, Fee, Item, and Expense journals. In Dynamics 365 Finance, you can edit the default tax attributes in Integration journals and Project invoice proposals.

GST calculation is included on the tax document for Expense integration journals. TDS/TCS calculation is included in the withholding tax in Expense integration journals.
