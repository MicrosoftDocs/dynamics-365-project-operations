# Dynamics 365 Project Operations

[!INCLUDE[banner](includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations connects sales, resourcing, project management, and finance teams in a single application to win more deals, accelerate project delivery, and maximize profitability.

-	**Leaders get business insights** to increase visibility across all teams, data, and processes, plus AI capabilities for better and faster business decisions.
-	**Sales is enabled** to win more deals and accelerate the sales cycle with fast and accurate quotes, flexible pricing, and seamless transitions from estimate to execution.
-	**Resourcing is set up to optimize** resource use by aligning the right people, with the right skills, to the right projects. This alignment improves quality and helps to retain top performers.
-	**Project managers can accelerate** project delivery with state-of-the-art, built-in project management that uses familiar, easy-to-use Microsoft Project capabilities.
-	**Team members can improve productivity**, collaboration, and visibility with integration to Microsoft Teams, and submit time and expenses from anywhere.
-	**Finance can simplify project accounting** with time and expense tracking governance, project costing, budgeting, invoicing, revenue recognition, compliance, and visibility into key business health metrics.

Project Operations is powerful on its own, but can be expanded by our customers who require more capabilities from Dynamics 365. These capabilities include Marketing, Human Resources, Customer Service, and more. Whether you want the added functionality of another Dynamics 365 application or to add on a custom application built with Power Apps, everything works together and works like you expect because they share the common foundation of a secure, private, and compliant cloud-delivered solution.
