_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

To utilize the capabilities described in this article, it's necessary to activate the following features in the Feature Management workspace.

-  **Enable subcontract actuals processing with Project Operations for resource-based scenarios**.
-  **Enable Intercompany Vendor invoices for resource-based/non-stocked scenarios**.

## Minimum version required

To use this feature for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations non-stocked/resource-based scenarios, the following versions are required:

- **Project Operations Dataverse** version 4.88.0.0 or later.
- **Dynamics 365 Finance** version 10.0.38 or later.

## Run dual-write maps for the vendor invoice lines

Make sure that the mapping for Project Operations integration **project vendor invoice line export entity** and **msdyn_projectvendorinvoicelines** use version **1.0.0.6** or later.

The following screenshot shows the dual-write entity map that's used for vendor invoice lines.

## Create and post an intercompany vendor invoice

**USPM**, the lending legal entity, must create and post the intercompany vendor invoice for a project from **GBPM**, the borrowing legal entity. 
This **vendor invoice** represents the outsourced labor and expense that were performed by vendors that are paid by USPM.

To create an intercompany invoice, follow these steps.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payables** > **Invoices** > **Pending vendor invoices**.
1. To create a vendor invoice, on the **Action** pane, select **New**.
1. On the **Invoice header**, in the **Invoice account field**, select **Subcontractor**.
1. Select the **Invoice date**.
1. On the **Invoice line** FastTab, select **Add line** to create a **vendor invoice line**.
1. Select the **Procurement category** that was created for subcontract lines, and enter the **unit price**, **unit of measurement**, and **quantity**.
1. In the **vendor invoice lines** section, on the **Project tab**, select the Project company **GBPM** and the **project** from the **GBPM** company.
1. Select the **Project category**. It can be of type **expenses** or **hours**. If the selected **project category** is of the hour type, select the role.
1. Select **Post** to post the vendor invoice.

After the **vendor invoice** has been successfully posted, it becomes accessible within Microsoft Dataverse for verification and processing by the **project manager**. For more information about the process of verifying vendor invoices in Dataverse, see **[Verification of vendor invoices](VI-Verification.md)**. Upon confirmation of an **intercompany vendor invoice** in Dataverse, this action triggers the generation of corresponding actual transactions within the Dataverse system.

| Transaction type  | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cost  | This transaction is created for the borrowing legal entity and doesn't synchronize with Dynamics 365 Finance for integration journal posting.  |
| Unbilled sales  | This transaction is created for Borrowing legal entity and synchronizes with Dynamics 365 Finance for integration journal posting.  |
| Inter-organizational sales | This transaction is created for Lending legal entity and synchronizes with Dynamics 365 Finance for integration journal posting.         |
| Resourcing unit cost | This transaction is created for lending legal entity and synchronizes with Dynamics 365 Finance for integration journal posting.          |

## Post the integration journal for the lending legal entity

After the vendor invoice is validated and approved by the Project manager within Dataverse, the subsequent step involves the posting of **Project Integration Journals** in Dynamics 365 Finance specifically for the lending legal entity.

To post the integration journal for the lending legal entity, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Project management and accounting** > **Periodic** > **Project Operations on Customer Engagement** > **Import from staging** and select to run the periodic process. This periodic process fills in Project Operations Integration journal.
1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Journals** > **Project Operations integration journal** and review the journal lines. The system creates the journal lines for **Inter-organizational sales** and **Resourcing unit cost**.
1. On the **Action** pane, select **Post** to post the integration journal.

Following the completion of the **Project integration journal** posting, the subsequent action entails generating an **Intercompany customer invoice** by the **lending legal entity**, succeeded by the **vendor invoice posting** performed by the **borrowing legal entity**.
