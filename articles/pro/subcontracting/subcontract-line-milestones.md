# Subcontract line milestones

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, a subcontract line with a fixed-price billing method can specify a milestone-based invoice schedule with the vendor.

Milestones for vendor invoicing can be generated automatically using a set frequency, or you can create them manually.

## Automatically create a milestone-based invoice schedule for a subcontract line

Complete the following steps to automatically generate a milestone-based invoice schedule for a fixed set of equally distributed milestones.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Invoice Frequencies** and set up the invoice frequency for the subcontract lines.
2. Open the **Subcontracts** page, open the subcontract that you want to work with, and then open the fixed-price subcontract line for which you are going to create a milestone schedule.
3. On the **Subcontract Line Milestones** tab, select **Generate Periodic Milestones**.
4. In the dialog box, enter or select a date range, the number of milestones, and the invoice frequency. You can select a start date, or you can select the number of milestones and the invoice frequency or start date, or you can select the end date and invoice frequency. You can't select the end date and the number of milestones.
Using this information, the system generates milestones and records that are shown in the **Milestones** grid.

   - **Milestone Name** - The name of the milestone is set to the date of the milestone based on the invoice frequency.
   - **Milestone Date** - The date based on the invoice frequency.
   - **Milestone Amount** - Calculated by dividing the subtotal amount on the subcontract line by the number of milestones.

If the subcontract line has a value in the **Estimated Tax Amount** field, this value is added to each milestone equally when generating periodic milestones.

The sum of the subcontract line milestone amounts should be equal to the value of the subcontract line. If they aren't equal, an error occurs. You can fix the error and verify that the milestone total is equal to the subcontract line value by creating, editing, or deleting milestone and tax amounts. After the changes are made, save and refresh the page to ensure that there are no more errors.

## Manually create subcontract line milestones

Fixed-price milestones on a subcontract line can be generated manually when they aren't periodically split. To create a subcontract line milestone manually, complete the following steps.

1. On the navigation pane, select **Subcontracts** and open the subcontract you want to work with.
2. Open the fixed price subcontract line for which you want to create a milestone.
3. On the **Subcontract line milestones** tab, on the sub grid, select **+ New Subcontract Line Milestone**.
4. On the **New Subcontract Line Milestone** page, enter the required information based on the following table.

    | Field | Description |Functional impact|
    | --- | --- |----------------------|
    | Milestone Name | The name of the milestone. |This will be shown as the first column in all lookups based on subcontract line milestones. The vendor invoice line that is created based on this milestone will also use the name of the subcontract line milestone as the default name of the vendor invoice line.|
    | Description | A description of the milestone. |The vendor invoice line that is created based on this milestone will also use the description of the subcontract line milestone as the default description of the vendor invoice line.|
    | Milestone Date | The date when the automatic invoice creation process should look for the status of this milestone to consider it for invoicing.| This value will be used as the default date of the vendor invoice line when invoicing for this subcontract line. |
    | Amount | The amount or value of the milestone that will be invoiced to the customer. |This value is used as the default amount on the vendor invoice line when invoicing for this subcontract line. |
    | Tax | The tax amount applied on the milestone.| This value is used as the default tax amount on the vendor invoice line when invoicing for this subcontract line. |
    | Amount after tax | This read-only field is calculated as Amount + Tax.|This value is used as the default on the vendor invoice line when invoicing for this subcontract line. |
    | Invoice Status | When the milestone is created, this status is always set to  **Not ready for invoicing**.|  When the status is **Ready to Invoice**, the vendor invoice creation includes this milestone on the vendor invoice. |

5. Select **Save and Close**.
