# Set up subcontractors as bookable resources

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Follow these steps to set up subcontractors as bookable resources in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations.

1. Go to **Project** \> **Resources**, and select **New**.
2. On the **New Bookable Resource** page, in the **Resource Type** field, select one of the following options:

    - **User** – Select this resource type if the subcontractor must access Project Operations to enter time or expenses. If you select **User**, the subcontractor requires a valid license to access the system.
    - **Contact** or **Account** – Select one of these resource types if the subcontractor doesn't require access to Project Operations, but must be available for task assignments or bookings on projects. Neither of these resource types provides access to the system. Select **Account** to represent the company of the vendor as a bookable resource. Select **Contact** to represent the individual employees of the vendor.

3. Depending on the resource type that you selected, you're prompted to select the corresponding user, account, or contact record.
4. In the **Type of Worker** field, select the "Contract worker" to set up the subcontractor as a bookable resource.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you leave the **Type of Worker** field blank, the bookable resource will be considered as an employee.

5. If you selected **Contract Worker** as the type of worker, select the vendor that the resource works for..
6. Select the time zone of the resource, and then select **Save**. To assign a work hour template to the bookable resource, you can select **Set calendar** on the **Bookable Resource** list page.

To be associated with a subcontract line, a bookable resource must meet these conditions:

- The bookable resource must be a contract worker.
- A bookable resource of the **Contact** resource type must be associated with the vendor account as a contact. A bookable resource of the **User** resource type doesn't have to be associated with the vendor account as a contact.
- The value of the **Vendor** field for the bookable resource must match the value of the **Vendor** field for the subcontract.

## Update the type of worker and vendor mapping for bookable resources

The **Type of worker** field for a bookable resource determines whether the bookable resource is a contract worker or an employee. The **Vendor** field defines the vendor account that the bookable resource is associated with. By associating a bookable resource with a vendor as a contact, you indicate that the contact is an employee of the vendor company.

If the **Type of Worker** and **Vendor** fields for a bookable resource are changed, the changes affect any future validations on new records that the bookable resource creates, such as time entries. However, the changes don't invalidate existing records.
