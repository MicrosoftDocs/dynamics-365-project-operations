# Import estimates from a project to a project contract line

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing, Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios__

In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can import estimates from a project to a project-based contract line.

1. Verify that the **Project** field on the project-based contract line has been filled in.
2. On the **Contract Line Details** tab, on the subgrid, select **Import from Project Estimation**. A dialog page with summarization options opens. Summarization options available are **Transaction Class**, **Category**, **Role**, and **Project Task**.
3. Based on the summary selection, the estimate from the project for all the transaction classes and tasks included on this contract line are copied. To check what transaction classes are included, on the **General** tab on the project-based contract line, check the values in the **Include Time**, **Include Expenses**, and **Include Fees** fields. 
4. To see what tasks are included, select the **Chargeable Tasks** tab on the contract line. Based on the associated tasks that have the field **Included Transaction Classes** set to **Yes**, all estimates for those task and transaction class combinations are imported to the contract line.

When you import estimates, the system defaults pricing based on the project price lists attached to the contract and billing type setup on the contract line. If a task, role, or category is set up on the contract line as non-chargeable, the imported estimate line will be non-chargeable and will not add up to the contracted value of the contract line.

When a contract line has line details, the **Contract Value** and **Estimated Tax** fields on the contract line are summarized and can't be edited.

When multiple summarization options are selected, the system attempts to summarize by all of the selected options. The summarization output results in more imported contract lines than if you select only one summarization option.

For example, if the project has the following estimate lines for expenses:

| Task | Category | Date | Quantity | Unit price | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task A | Airfare | 10/1/2020 | 4 | 400 | 1600 |
| Task B | Hotel | 10/1/2020 | 4 | 200 | 800 |
| Task C | Hotel | 11/1/2020 | 2 | 200 | 400 |

When the user selects to summarize by **Transaction Class**, the following information will be imported:

| Task | Category | Date | Quantity | Unit price | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 10/1/2020 | 3.34 | 840 | 2800 |

When the user selects to summarize by **Transaction Class** and **Category**, the following information will be imported:

| Task | Category | Date | Quantity | Unit price | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task A | Airfare | 10/1/2020 | 4 | 400 | 1600 |
| &nbsp;| Hotel | 10/1/2020 | 6 | 200 | 1200 |

When the user selects to summarize by **Transaction Class**, **Category**, and **Leaf Node Task**, the following will be imported. Notice that this result is the same as what is on the project:

| Task | Category | Date | Quantity | Unit price | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task A | Airfare | 10/1/2020 | 4 | 400 | 1600 |
| Task B | Hotel | 10/1/2020 | 4 | 200 | 800 |
| Task C | Hotel | 11/1/2020 | 2 | 200 | 400 |
