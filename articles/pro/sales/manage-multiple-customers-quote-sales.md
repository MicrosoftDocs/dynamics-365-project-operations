# Manage multiple customers on project quotes

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Project quotes support the scenario where the proposal involves multiple customers who will fund the deal. The **Summary** tab of the Quote has the **Potential customer** field that identifies the primary customer of the deal. Other customers for the deal can be set up on the **Customers** tab of the project quote.

All quote customers on the **Customers** tab of the project quote default as quote line customers on any **new** project-based quote lines created for the quote. Any existing project-based quote lines will not inherit new quote customer records created after them.

Product-based quote lines are automatically associated to the primary customer who is also the customer in the **Potential Customer** field on the **Summary** tab of the quote.

Quote customers and quote line customers can be added, updated, or deleted at any time before the quote is won.

## Concept of a primary customer

The customer who is on the summary tab of the project quote as the potential customer is the primary customer of the quote. When you try to delete the primary customer from customers list on quote, you will see an error that a primary customer record on a quote cannot be deleted.

The primary customer shouldn't be updated from the customer list on the quote. However, you can influence the primary customer by changing the potential customer on the **Summary** tab of the quote. When this field is updated on the **Quote Summary**, the newly selected potential customer is added as a new quote customer with the **Primary** flag set. The old potential customer will still be a customer on the quote.

## Create, Update, or Delete a quote customer record

A quote customer can be created, updated, or deleted from the **Quote customers** tab on the **Quote** page. The fields listed in the following table are on the quote customer record of a project quote.

| **Field** | **Location** | **Description** | **Downstream impact** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account | Editable grid on the **Quote Customers** tab and the **Main** and **Quick Create** forms for a quote customer. | Lists all the active accounts. This field is locked after the record is created. If you want to update it, delete the record, and re-create it. If you have recorded any actuals, or if the quote customer record is a primary customer, you will not be allowed to delete the record. | Quote customers are copied over as quote line customers when a quote line is created. Quote customers are also copied over to the project contract customers when a quote is won. |

| Bill to Name | Editable grid on the **Quote Customers** tab and the **Main** and **Quick Create** forms for a quote customer. | This text field should be used to identify the invoice contact person for this customer. | Copied to the project contract customers when a quote is won and in turn to the **Bill to Contract Name** field on the invoice that is generated for this customer. |

| Is Rounding | Editable grid on the **Quote Customers** tab and the **Main** and **Quick Create** forms for a quote customer. | Indicates if this customer is a default rounding customer for this deal. | Copied to the project contract customers when a quote is won. |

## Editing billing split percentages

You can edit the billing split percentages by using the in-line grid edit experience. When the billing split percentages don't total 100%, an error will occur. After you update the billing split percentages, refresh the page to remove the error.

You can also try selecting **Evenly Distribute** on the quote customers' subgrid. This action allocates billing splits to all quote customers. If there is any rounding factor, that will be added to the rounding customer. One of the quote customers is always tagged as the rounding customer. this means that the quote customer record has the **Rounding** flag set to **Yes**. Typically this is the primary customer of the quote, but that can be changed.
