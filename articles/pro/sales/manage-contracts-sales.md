# Manage project contracts

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Core deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Project contracts in Dynamics 365 Project Operations capture and manage the contractually agreed on commitments and billing details of a project. The structure of a project contract in Project Operations is tailored to project-based work with the following components:

- Contract lines that identify the discrete components of work that will be presented as high-level components on a project invoice.
- Contract line details that identify and estimate the work for each high-level component or contract line. The estimate includes the schedule and the financial aspects for the work tied to the contract line.
- Contracting models and chargeable components are set up for each contract line that holds the billing arrangement for each contract line and the overall contract.

## View all project-based contracts

A list of all project contracts can be seen on the **Contracts** list page. 

1. Go to **Sales** > **Contracts**. A list of all your project Contracts in the system are shown. 
2. Select the **View switcher** (the drop-down arrow next to the name of the view) to select other filtered views. You can create your own views with custom filter criteria.

Contracts can be created or deleted from this list page or detail pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Contracts that have projects, tasks, estimates, journals, and/or actuals associated with them cannot be deleted.
