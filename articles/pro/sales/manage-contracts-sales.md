# Manage project contracts

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Project contracts in Dynamics 365 Project Operations capture and manage the contractually agreed commitments and billing details of a project. The structure of a project contract in Project Operations is tailored to project-based work with the following components:

- Contract lines that identify the discrete components of work that the project presents as high-level components on an invoice.
- Contract line details that identify and estimate the work for each high-level component or contract line. The estimate includes the schedule and the financial aspects for the work tied to the contract line.
- Contracting models and chargeable components that you set up for each contract line hold the billing arrangement for each contract line and the overall contract.

## View all project-based contracts

You can see a list of all project contracts on the **Contracts** list page. 

1. Go to **Sales** > **Contracts**. You see a list of all your project contracts in the system. 
1. Select the **View switcher** (the drop-down arrow next to the name of the view) to select other filtered views. You can create your own views with custom filter criteria.

You can create or delete contracts from this list page or from detail pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete contracts that have projects, tasks, estimates, journals, or actuals associated with them.
