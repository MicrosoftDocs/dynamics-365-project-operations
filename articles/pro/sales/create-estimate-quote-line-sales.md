# Estimate a project quote line

_**Applies To:** Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing, Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

A project-based quote line has details that help with estimating the cost and potential revenue of the work involved to deliver the quote line.

To estimate a project-based quote line, on the project-based quote line, select the **Quote Line Detail** tab. There are two ways to create an estimate on a project-based quote line:

- Manually create the estimate directly on the quote line using quote line details. 
- Create a project and a project plan, and then associate the project and tasks on the project to the quote line. The process to import the estimates on the project plan into the quote line based on the information you provided will be enabled.

## Update prices on quote line details

If you have changed prices on the project price list that is attached to the quote, or on the cost price list of the contracting unit, you can select **Recalculate** on the **Quote** page to refresh the prices on the individual quote line details to reflect this change. When you select **Recalculate**, a warning appears that informs you that prices on quote line details for all quote lines on this quote will be reset. Select **Yes** to refresh prices for both sales and cost quote line details.

## Access quote line details for cost

On the **Quote Line Details** tab, select a row in the grid to enable some actions on the toolbar of the subgrid. The first action on the subgrid tool bar when a quote line detail is selected is **Open Cost Detail**. Select **Open Cost Detail** to see the related cost rate and amount for this quote line.

Use these calculations only on project contracts as these are approximations and are not for actual statutory or other reporting that requires higher precision of rounding and awareness of date effectivity for exchange rates.
