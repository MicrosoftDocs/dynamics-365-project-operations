# Invoice a retainer or an advance

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports retainer-based contracts and one-time advances. On a project contract, you can record a schedule of retainers or a one-time advance. However, recording at the project contract level doesn't immediately make a retainer or advance available for use. To use a retainer or advance on an invoice that actually charges the customer, the retainer or advance must be invoiced first.

Complete the following steps to invoice a retainer or an advance.

1. Select **Sales** > **Billing** > **Retainers and Advances**. 
2. On the **Advances and Retainers** page, use the filter to select the specific retainer or advance to invoice and mark it as **Ready to Invoice**.
3. Create an invoice either manually from the **Project Contract** list or detail page. The retainer or advance is shown on the draft invoice in the **Advances and Retainers** section on the **Invoice** page.
4. Confirm the invoice. This will make the retainer or advance available for use. You can verify the invoice on the **Retainers and Advances** list page. For an invoiced Advance or Retainer, the available amount is shown in the grid.

## Create a retainer or advance from the Invoice grid

You can create a retainer or an advance directly on an invoice.

1. On a draft invoice, on the **Advances and Retainers** subgrid, select **New** to create a new retainer or advance. 
2. On the **Quick Create** page, add the necessary information, and then select **Save**. The retainer or advance is created on the project contract related to the invoice. The retainer or advance is automatically marked as **Ready to Invoice** and then added to the **Advances and Retainers** subgrid on the **Invoice** page.

## Reconcile an invoiced retainer or advance

After a retainer or advance is invoiced, they can be used or reconciled on an invoice with time, expenses, milestones, or other project-based charges. The customer will see their invoice amount reduced by the retainer or advance amount used on this invoice.

On every invoice that is generated for a project contract that has invoiced retainers or advances, Project Operation automatically applies the retainer or advance to the invoice.

This can be seen in the **Applied Retainers and Advances** grid on the **Invoice** page. The following table provides information about the fields on the **Applied Retainers and Advances** grid of the **Project Invoice** page.
