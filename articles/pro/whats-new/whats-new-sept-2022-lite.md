## Features included in this release

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opportunity Management | **Revision and Activation of Quotes**<br>Project Operations brings in the full support of the sales process. Project quotes can be activated to represent a state where the quote is read-only and is being reviewed. Activated quotes can be revised to create new quotes that have an incremented revision number. Activated project quotes or quote revisions can be closed as won or lost. | [Activate and revise a project quote](/dynamics365/project-operations/sales/activation-and-revision) |
| Billing and Pricing | **Time-zone agnostic price defaulting**<br>Project Operations has introduced the concept of a time-zone agnostic date on all project actuals. A new field, **Transaction date**, is now available on journal lines and actuals, and will be used to store the date when the transaction occurred, but without converting that date to Coordinated Universal Time. This date will be used for downstream processes such as price defaulting and invoice creation. | <p>[Determine cost rates for project-based estimates and actuals](/dynamics365/project-operations/pro/pricing-costing/cost-price-resolution-sales)</p><p>[Determine sales prices for project-based estimates and actuals](/dynamics365/project-operations/pro/pricing-costing/sales-price-resolution-sales)</p> |
| Billing and Pricing | **Date-effective price overrides in Project Operations**<br>Date-effective price overrides provide a way to override or change specific prices in the price list. | [Date-effective price overrides](/dynamics365/project-operations/pricing-costing/dateffective_price_overrides) |
| Time and Expense | **Global Approver**<br>This feature enables independent software vendor (ISV) and centralized approval, regardless of the project or team member status in the project. | [Security and approvals](/dynamics365/project-operations/approvals/approvals-security) |
|Project Planning and Tracking|**Use Project schedule APIs to perform operations with Scheduling entities** </br> </br>The resource assignment contour editing API lets developers programmatically specify a task assignee's effort across any supported date range for more granular time phased effort planning.|[Use Project schedule APIs to perform operations with Scheduling entities](/dynamics365/project-operations/project-management/schedule-api-preview)|
