## Features included in this release

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Opportunity Management|**Minimize the creation of roles and categories for performance**. </br>This feature works to minimize this data creation to what’s included in the quote line details and ultimately what’s included in the associated project plan. </br>In metadata updates, changes were made to quote and contract line forms to display both overrides and global tables. New and delete buttons were reinstated for override subgrids, and quote and contract line forms were added for all override types. The override main forms now include references to quote or contract lines. In UI, references for overrides are locked in noncreate forms, and unsupported billing type options like null, complimentary, and not available were removed. ||

You can only set the Resource, Resourcing Unit (etc.) field(s) if it's applicable and configured within **Settings** > **Amount Based Pricing Dimensions**. Those fields for Role Price are now hidden to avoid confusion if there's no dimension configuration.|
