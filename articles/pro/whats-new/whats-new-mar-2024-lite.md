## Features included in this release

| **Feature area** | **Feature name** | **More information** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Management | **Removal of team member limits for externally scheduled projects**<br><br>For externally scheduled projects, we no longer impose the limit of 300 resources assigned per project. This limit was due to the dependency on Project for the web. | [External scheduling](../../project-management/external-scheduling.md) |
| Project Estimates | **Project estimate updates**<br><br>This feature enhancement simplifies the creation and editing of both **expense** and **material** estimates for a project. Previously, the **Materials** and **Expense estimates** tabs were separate, now they're consolidated into a new **Estimates** tab. Additionally, the previously labeled **Estimates** tab is updated to **Time phased estimates** with no other changes. The enhanced experience allows users to easily add new expense and material estimates using a quick create form, with the convenience of in-line editing directly on the grid. Within the grid of the new **Estimates** tab, two views are provided: **Expense** and **Materials**. Each grid displays the **Cost** line (parent) and **Sales** line (child). | [Financial estimates for expenses on projects](../../project-management/create-expense-estimates.md) |
| Project Management | **Copilot for project**<br><br>**Copilot for project** streamlines project management tasks the system in plain English. With an input of the project name and description, **Copilot generates a preliminary work breakdown structure**, simplifying the task planning process. For ongoing projects, Copilot for project facilitates **risk assessment by analyzing the risk register and providing suggested mitigations along with probabilities of occurrence** for each risk identified. Moreover, project managers can effortlessly **generate detailed status reports through Copilot, integrating concise summaries of scheduling and financial data while also delivering insightful content on overall project progress, financial performance, and schedule adherence.** Additionally, Copilot offers a Sidecar chat feature, **allowing users to initiate these actions through typed command**, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in project management. | [Project management Copilot overview](../../project-management/copilot-features.md) |
| Performa invoicing | **Improved project invoicing usability and performance**<br><br>The **Billing hub experience** aims to provide a rich, consolidated view of contracts, contract lines, related actuals, and key invoicing insights **prior to invoice creation** to help accountants and billing users create proforma invoices quickly and efficiently. Using the platform's out-of-the-box nested grid functionality, you can complete invoice creation from a single unified view, eliminating the need to navigate between forms or views to validate data, thus leading to faster processing of invoices. |     |
