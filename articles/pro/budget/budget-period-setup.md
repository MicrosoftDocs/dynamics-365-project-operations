_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

This article explains how to set up a budget period at the organizational level and at the project level.

> [!NOTE]
> A budget period at the project level is required to enable time phasing of budgeted values and quantities over the budget line's time period.

## What is a budget period?

A budget period defines a week, month, quarter, and fiscal periods in your organization.

For example, in some countries/regions, the fiscal year and quarter 1 begin on April 1. In other countries/regions, they begin on January 1. The work week might begin on Monday or Sunday.

A budget period that's set up at the organization level is available for consumption at the project level. However, a project manager can override the organization-level budget period configuration at the project level to meet the requirements of a specific project.

## Set up a budget period at the organization level

To set up or edit a budget period at the organization level, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations.
1. Go to the **Settings** section in the lower-left navigation.
1. In the **General** category, select **Organizational Units**.
1. Find and select the desired organizational unit to open the main page.
1. On the **Budget Period** tab, if there's no existing budget period in the grid, select **New Budget Period** to create one.
1. Select **Save & Close**. A budget period line is created in the grid.
1. To view or modify the budget period details, double-tap (or double-click) the budget period line.
1. Make any required updates, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Save** or **Save & Close**. Depending on your updates, the budget period detail line is extended, or it's deleted and then re-created.

> [!NOTE]
> A budget period that's set up at the organization level serves as a template that you can easily copy and apply at the project level to meet your specific requirements. This approach streamlines the process of setting up budget periods for individual projects. It also helps ensure consistency and efficiency across different projects in the organization.

## Set up a budget period at the project level

To set up a budget period at the project level, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to Project Operations.
1. Go to the **Projects** section in the lower-left navigation.
1. Select **Projects** to view the list of active projects.
1. Find and select the desired project to open the project main page.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Budget**, and then select **Create budget period** on the dropdown menu.

The budget period configuration dialog box for the selected project appears. If an organization-level budget period is set up, the **Fiscal start** and **Week starts on** values are taken from it. Otherwise, by default, the **Fiscal start** field is set to **July**, and the **Week starts on** field is set to **Monday**. By default, the **Start year** and **Start month** fields are set to the project's start year and month, and the **End year** and **End month** fields are set to the project's end year and month.

You can edit the budget period configuration at the project level to meet your specific requirements. The following table describes the fields that are available.

> [!NOTE]
> After you copy a budget period to the project level, subsequent changes to the organization-level configuration have no effect on the project-level configuration. The project-level budget period becomes independent of and isolated from the organization-level template.
