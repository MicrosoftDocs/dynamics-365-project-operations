# Column-Based Time Phasing of Project Budgets

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP and Project Operations Core._

This feature introduces a **column-based time phasing view** for project budgets, complementing the existing row-based layout.

A dedicated tab displays budget data in a column format, providing a clearer time-based breakdown.

Currently, this feature is available as a **limited private preview** with read-only rows. Additional enhancements are planned for upcoming release waves.

To enable the feature in a **pre-production environment**, open a support ticket with Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend enabling this feature in pre-production to validate its capabilities and share early feedback. This feature is **not yet ready for production rollout**.
