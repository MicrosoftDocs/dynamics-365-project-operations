# Create a project budget by importing from estimates

**_Applies to:_** _Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

## Enable the project cost budget feature

Project cost budgeting capabilities are enabled only if the feature flag is enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> After the project budget feature is enabled in an organization, it can't be disabled. However, you don't have to create a budget for every project.

To enable project cost budgeting, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations.
1. In the left navigation, change the area to **Settings**.
1. In the **General** section, select **Parameters**.
1. You should see a list of organization units. Double-tap (or double-click) the **Organization Units** row for the columns that aren't links.
1. On the **Project Parameters** page, in the **Feature Control** field, select **Feature Control**.
1. Select **Enable Project Budgeting Feature Flag**.

After you enable the project cost budget feature, the page is refreshed, and a **Budget match priorities** tab is added.

## Importing budget from estimates

Projects are planned by defining tasks, assigning resources, and estimating material and expense costs. This is reflected in the estimates of the project which can be referred under **Estimates** tab, in the project's page. 

By following these steps, a well-planned estimates can be used as the foundation for creating a project cost budget. This can be accomplished by importing the estimates into the budget. 

1. Sign in to Project Operations.
1. In the left navigation, change the area to **Projects**.
1. Select the project to create a budget for.
1. On the project page, on the Action Pane, select **Create Budget**, and then follow these steps:

    - Select **From estimates**. 
    
    - A dialog box will open, allowing you to choose the source for the time transaction class budget lines and specify the contingency percentage for all budget lines.
    
    - In the drop down for Time source, select **Resource Assignments** if you want to create time budget lines based on the resources assigned to the tasks. You can see these estimates under **Resource Assignments** tab in the project page. 
    
    - In the drop down for Time source, select **Project team members** if you want to create time budget lines based on the resources made part of project team members. You can see these under **Team** tab in the project page. 
    
    - In the **Contingency** section of the dialog box, indicate the percentage by which you would like to increase the Time, Material, and Expense budget lines as contingency.
    
    - The contingency amount for each budget line will be calculated as a percentage of the budgeted amount and added to the budgeted amount for that line.
    
    - Upon clicking the **Import** button, you will see an information strip on the project page indicating that the budget import from estimates is in progress.
         
    - 
    
    - A **Budget** tab is added to the page and budget lines which were successfully imported can be seen in the grid. 
    
       
After importing the estimates, you can make any necessary edits in the grid and can also add new budget lines, just as you would when creating a budget manually.
