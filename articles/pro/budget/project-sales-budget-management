# Project sales budget management

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

**_Applies to:_** _Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

This article explains how to create and manage **sales budget lines**.

The process for creating, reviewing, and approving sales budgets follows similar steps to cost budget management.

A project sales budget has budget lines that are a snapshot of the budgeted billed & unbilled sals actual's quantity and amount. 
Project budget lines can be created under three transaction classes:

- A **Time** budget line tracks the billed & unbilled sales actuals of bookable resources against the project. See [Project time budget lines](project-cost-time-budget-line.md) for more details.
- A **Material** budget line tracks the billed & unbilled sales actuals that are approved against the project. See [Project material budget lines](project-cost-material-budget-line.md) for more details.
- An **Expense** budget line tracks the billed & unbilled sales actuals that are approved against the project. See [Project expense budget lines](project-cost-expense-budget-line.md) for more details.
