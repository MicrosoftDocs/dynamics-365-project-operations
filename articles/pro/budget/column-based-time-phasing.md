# Column-based time phasing of project budgets

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP and Project Operations Core._

This feature introduces a **column-based time phasing view** for project budgets that complements the existing row-based layout.

A dedicated tab displays budget data in a column format and provides a clearer time-based breakdown.

This feature is currently available as a **limited private preview** with read-only rows. 

To enable this feature in a **preproduction environment**, open a support ticket with Microsoft.
