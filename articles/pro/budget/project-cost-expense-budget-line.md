# Project expense budget lines

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

**_Applies to:_** _Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

This article explains how to create budget lines for the **Expense** transaction class.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps outlined in this article apply to both cost and sales budget lines. The context field of the budget line determines whether you are dealing with a cost or sales budget line.

A project budget has budget lines that are a snapshot of the budgeted quantity and amount. Project budget lines can be created under three transaction classes:

- A **Time** budget line tracks the recorded and approved time of bookable resources against the project.
- A **Material** budget line tracks the consumed materials that are approved against the project.
- An **Expense** budget line tracks the approved expenses against the project.

> [!NOTE]
> Budget dimensions should be unique across all budget lines. You can't create multiple budget lines that have the same dimensions.

## Create an Expense budget line

**Prerequisite:** A project budget must be created for the project. For more information, see [Create and delete project cost budgets](create-delete-project-budget.md) or [Create and delete project sales budgets](create-delete-project-sales-budget.md)

To create a project budget line for the **Expense** transaction class, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations.
1. In the left navigation, change the area to **Projects**.
1. Select the project to create the **Expense** budget line for. Because a project budget was previously created, the **Budget** tab should be visible.
1. Select **New Project Budget Line** to create a budget line. A quick create dialog box appears. By default, the **Transaction class** field is set to **Time**.
1. Update all the fields in the dialog box according to the table that follows.
1. When you've finished, select **Save & Create New** to create another budget line, or select **Save & Close** to save the details and close the quick create dialog box.
1. You can edit budget line fields in the grid on the **Budget** tab. Changes are saved when you select the **Tab** key to move to the next line in the grid. Edits can be made only until the budget is submitted for approval.

The following table explains how to set the fields in the quick create dialog box to create an **Expense** budget line.

| Start Date | Mandatory | <p>Specify the start date for the budget line. The specified date must be between the start date and end date of the project. By default, this field is set to the start date of the project.</p><p>Together, this field and the **End Date** field define the period when the actuals of the projects are tracked against the budget line.</p> |
| End Date | Mandatory | <p>Specify the end date for the budget line. The specified date must be between the start date and end date of the project. By default, this field is set to the end date of the project.</p><p>Together, this field and the **Start Date** field define the period when the actuals of the projects are tracked against the budget line.</p> |
| Task | Optional | If you want to track the budget against a specific task of the project, select the task. To track the budget against all tasks of the project, leave this field blank. |
| Cost Source | Optional | Select **Internal** to track the costs where the cost source is internal. Select **External** to track the costs from a vendor or subcontractor. To track the costs from any cost source, leave this field blank. By default, this field is blank. |
| Vendor Name | Optional | If you selected **External** in the **Cost Source** field, select the vendor or subcontractor to track the costs from. To track the costs from any vendor or subcontractor, leave this field blank. By default, this field is blank. |
| Quantity | Optional | Specify the quantity to budget for the selected dimensions for time, materials, and expenses. The actual quantity will be tracked against the budgeted quantity only if the budget line has a quantity. If the quantity is left blank, only the amount will be tracked against the dimensions of the budget line. By default, this field is blank. |
| Unit Group | Optional | By default, if a transaction category is selected in the **Transaction category** field, this field is set to the unit group of that transaction category. If the **Transaction category** field is left blank, you can select a unit group in this field. |
| Unit | Optional | By default, if a transaction category is selected in the **Transaction category** field, this field is set to the unit of that transaction category. If the **Transaction category** field is left blank, you can select a unit in the list of units for the selected unit group.

By default, this field is set to the organization currency. |
| Amount | Mandatory | If you set the **Quantity** field, the amount is calculated as *Quantity* &times; *Unit price*. If you didn't set the **Quantity** field, enter the amount to budget against the selected dimensions of the budget line. The value must be a positive non-zero number. |
