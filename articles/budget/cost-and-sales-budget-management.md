This article provides the typical actions to be performed for cost and sales budget management in resource non-stocked deployment. 

As explained in the [project budget management overview](project-budget-management-overview-res-non-stocked.md) the project creation, actuals tracking against budget, budget approval, forecast update, budget revision happens on dataverse side. Approved budgets would be transfered to forecast tables on the Finance & Operations. 

A project budget can be created for all types of projects, fixed-price, time and material, and investment projects, for tracking both costs and sales budgets.

Here is the step by step process of creation and approval of project budgets in dataverse.

1. Open the project main form on the dataverse platform for which you want to create a budget.
1. If you want to time phase the budget line into budget line details, create the project budget periods as explained in [budget period setup](../pro/budget/budget-period-setup.md)
1. You can create budget from estimates or quote or contract by following the steps explained in [create budget from estimates](../pro/budget/create-project-budget-from-estimates.md).
1. As an alternative you can choose to create budget without importing from estimates by following the steps explained in Open the project main form on the dataverse platform for which you want to create a budget.
   
1. In the left navigation, change the area to **Projects**.
