# Pay when paid vendor payments

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP_

This article explains how to use the pay when paid (PWP) scenario.

## Create a purchase order that has PWP terms

When you post an invoice from a vendor, if the vendor is subject to PWP terms, those terms appear on the purchase order (PO) lines. To create a PO that has PWP terms, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, follow one of these steps:

    - Go to **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**. On the Action Pane, select **New**. In the **Create purchase order** dialog box, select the vendor for which you set up PWP terms on the project, enter other required information, and then select **OK**.
    - Go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. On the Action Pane, on the **Manage** tab, select **Item task**. Select the purchase order. Select the vendor for which you set up PWP terms on the project, and then select **OK**.

1. On the **Purchase order** page, on the **Purchase order lines** Fast Tab, select **Add line** to create a purchase order line.
1. Select the item number or procurement category, and enter the other required details. Review the details of the PO line for the vendor.

    The **Pay when paid** option is automatically selected, and the value in the **PWP threshold percentage** field is automatically copied from the **PWP threshold percentage** field on the **Projects** page.

1. If you don't want to apply PWP terms to the vendor for a PO line, clear the **Pay when paid** option. In this case, the **PWP threshold percentage** field for the PO line is reset to **0** (zero).
1. On the **Purchase order** page, on the Action Pane, on the **Purchase** tab, select **Confirm** to confirm the purchase order.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Invoice** tab, select **Invoice** to generate the invoice for the purchase order.

## Create a project invoice proposal

Use project invoice proposals to create project invoices for the customer. In the PWP scenario, vendor payments depend on customer payments according to the PWP settings. However, you can choose to release the payments without customer payments. To create a project invoice for the customer, follow these steps:

1. In customer engagement apps, go to **Project** > **Projects**, and select the project.
1. On the **Actuals** tab, select the actual line that's generated by the PO that has the **Unbilled sales** transaction type. Then select **Ready for invoice**.
1. Go to **Sales** > **Sales** > **Project contract**, and select the project contract.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Invoice** to generate the customer invoice.
1. In Finance, go to **Project management and accounting** > **Periodic** > **Import from staging table**, and select **OK** to generate the Project operations integration journal.
1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Project invoices** > **Project invoice proposal**, and select **Post** to post the invoice proposal that you generated for the project.

## Update a customer payment and pay the vendor

When a vendor completes its work on a project and sends you an invoice, review the project status and customer invoices to determine whether the PWP terms are met for the project. If the PWP terms are met, you can determine which lines on the vendor invoice to pay, based on the customer payments for the project. If you decide to pay the vendor even though the PWP terms aren't met, you can override the PWP terms on the **Vendor invoice with pay when paid** page.

1. In Finance, go to **Project management and accounting** > **Projects** > **All projects**, and select the project.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Control**, and then select **Vendor invoices** to show all vendor invoices that are generated for the project.
1. On the **Vendor invoices with pay when paid** page, in the search field, enter values to find the vendor invoice that you want to review, and then select **Search**.
1. Select the **Pay when paid** option to view only PWP invoices.
1. On the **Vendor invoice lines** Fast Tab, select the lines that you want to release for payment.
1. Select **Release vendor payment**. The **Pay when paid** option is cleared, and the value of the **Ready for payment** field is changed to **Yes**.
