# Use procurement categories with project purchase orders and pending vendor invoices

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Purchasing professionals can create and maintain catalogs of the items and services that can be used in project purchase orders and pending vendor invoices. [Procurement catalogs](/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/procurement-catalogs) give you an easy way to categorize purchases without having to configure and use a released products catalog. Each procurement category can be mapped to a project category for time, expense, or item transactions. After a pending vendor invoice that uses a procurement category is posted, the system will create time, expense, or material project actuals, project transactions, and subledger entries.

## Minimum version requirements

The following versions are required to use procurement categories with project purchase orders for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations non-stocked/resource-based scenarios:

- Project Operations Dataverse solution version 4.41.0.45 or later
- Finance and operations environment version 10.0.26 or later

## Run dual-write maps for procurement category support

Make sure that the mapping for **Project Operations integration project vendor invoice line export entity msdyn\_projectvendorinvoicelines** uses version 1.0.0.4 or later.

## Enable the feature key for procurement categories

Follow these steps to enable the functionality for using procurement categories with project purchase orders.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, open the **Feature management** workspace.
1. In the feature list, find the **Use procurement categories in Project Operations for resource based/non-stocked scenarios** feature, and then select **Enable**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a prerequisite, you must also enable the **Enable pending vendor invoices on Project Operations for resource based/non-stocked scenarios** feature.

## Map project categories in the Procurement category hierarchy

Follow these steps to map project categories to procurement categories in the **Procurement category** hierarchy:

1. Go to **Procurement and sourcing \> Procurement categories**.
1. Select **Edit category hierarchy**.
1. Select the desired category hierarchy node, and then, on the **Assign project categories** tab, associate the node with the project category from the **Time**, **Expense**, or, **Item Project** category (that is, the **Default-Time** or **Default-Expense** category).
1. Select **Save**.
1. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Mapping a procurement category to a project category is optional. If a procurement category isn't mapped, the system will use the value that is set in the **Item** field in the **Project category defaults** section on the **Project Operations on Dynamics 365 Customer engagement** tab of the **Project management and accounting parameters** page.
