# Copilot for time entry responsible AI FAQ

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about using Copilot in time entry within Project Operations.

### What is Copilot in time entry?

Time Entry Copilot acts as a new way for project team members to complete all activities related to logging weekly time entries, in a streamlined manner. The goal is to take away the tedious nature of the time entry process by giving team members a way to log their time.

### What can Copilot in time entry do?

To begin with, Copilot is enabled with a limited set of capabilities and receive updates over the coming months. The currently supported scenarios are summarized: 

- Copilot can use team members’ project assignments to suggest time entries for that week that can be used to create draft time entries without duplication. Final control over what gets submitted for approval is left with the team members, who can modify these entries before submission.
- Copilot can also generate a first draft of customer-facing comments for each entry. These comments are generated by using information like _Project, Project Task, Role_ and _Duration_ and harnessing the abilities of large language models powered by Azure OpenAI for each time entry. These generated comments can then be edited to meet customer requirements before saving to each time entry. This feature significantly reduces the time taken to add comments to all entries for a week when compared to the existing, form-based experience.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The fields being considered (Project, Project Task, Role and Duration) cannot currently be customised for generating external comments.

### What are Copilot in time entry's intended uses?

As an AI assistant for project team members, the intended uses of Time Entry Copilot are: 

- **Creation of time entries** - Project team members use Copilot to create their time entries for the current week, based on the user's existing project assignments.
- **Add comments** - Users can also generate and link generated descriptions to these entries after required modifications and submit them for approval in a more efficient manner when compared to the existing process that is followed.

This section will be updated with other intended uses over time, as Copilot in time entry receives updates with each release. 

### How was Copilot in time entry evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

- Time Entry Copilot has gone through a series of functional evaluations to ensure that it is able to effectively respond to the user scenarios that it is intended for.
- Copilot in time entry is aimed at improving the life of project team members. Our priority is to ensure it is developed according to [Microsoft’s Responsible AI standards](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4ZPmV) before being deployed to users.
  -  To ensure this goal, a process involving rigorous assessments around privacy, security (red teaming for varied threats), accessibility, etc are completed before being deployed to customers.  

### What are the limitations of Time Entry Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of Time Entry Copilot’s limitations when using the system? 

- As of now, Copilot can only log time for the current week (week in which date of time entry creation resides) and cannot be used for a past or future week. This can be minimized by ensuring timely creation of time entries before the end of the current week so that you do not have to create entries for an older week.
  - **Note**: Copilot does not use the user’s local time zone settings. It instead considers the UTC date (as per GMT+0 time zone) while selecting the week for which time is being logged.
- Copilot does not refresh the time entry grid in real-time on completion of an action that is triggered from the sidecar. The user will must refresh the time entry grid to view these changes.


### What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of Time Entry Copilot? 

- Consistently ensuring that team members are “assigned” to project tasks before they begin working on them will make Copilot an effective mode of creating time entries.
- Team members that use Copilot to create their time entries must ensure they review the suggested entries before creating them. In addition to this step, any external comments generated via Copilot must be vetted by the user to ensure they meet customer standards before being submitted for approval.
- Existing customizations that are in place for Time Entry will not work out-of-the-box with Copilot scenarios. Additional effort is required to integrate them into Copilot scenarios, please raise a support ticket with Microsoft for assistance with integrating critical customizations.
