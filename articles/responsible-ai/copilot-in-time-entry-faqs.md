# Copilot for time entry responsible AI FAQ

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about using Copilot in time entry within Project Operations.

### What is Copilot in time entry?

Time Entry Copilot acts as a new way for project team members to complete all activities related to logging weekly time entries, in a streamlined manner. The goal is to take away the tedious nature of the time entry process by giving team members a way to log their time.

### What can Copilot in time entry do?

To begin with, Copilot will be enabled with a limited set of capabilities and will receive updates over the coming months. Currently supported scenarios are: 

Time Entry Copilot can use team members’ project assignments to suggest time entries for that week that can be used to create draft time entries without duplication. Final control over what gets submitted for approval is left with the team members, who can modify these entries before submission.  

Copilot can also generate a first draft of customer-facing comments or descriptions for each entry. These comments are generated by using information like _Project, Project Task, Role_ and _Duration_ and harnessing the abilities of large language models powered by Azure Open AI for each time entry. These generated comments can then be edited to meet customer requirements before saving to each time entry. This will significantly reduce the time taken to add comments to all entries for a week when compared to the existing, form-based experience.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The fields being considered (Project, Project Task, Role and Duration) cannot currently be customised for generating external comments.
