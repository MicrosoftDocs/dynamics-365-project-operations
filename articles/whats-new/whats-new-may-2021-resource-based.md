## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

The following list shows the dual-write maps that have been modified or added in the Project Operations May 2021 release.

| Entity map | Updated version | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project funding source (msdyn\_projectcontractsplitbillingrules) | 1.0.0.2 | Syncing project contract customer terms of payment. |
| Project invoice proposal V2 (invoices) | 1.0.0.3 | Syncing proforma invoice terms of payment. |
| Project Operations integration project vendor invoice line export entity (msdyn\_projectvendorinvoicelines) | 1.0.0.1 | Quality updates |
| Projects V2 (msdyn\_projects) | 1.0.0.2 | Quality updates |

Always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and finance and operations apps solution version. Certain features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map isn't activated. You can see the active version of the map in the  **Version**  column on the  **Dual-write**  page. To activate a new version of the map, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and then save the selected version. If you have customized an out-of-the-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue with starting the map, follow the instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual-Write troubleshooting guide.
