# What's new December 2024 - Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

**Applies To:**  Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios.

This article applies to the following components and versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations:

- Project Operations in a Microsoft Dataverse environment version 4.122.0.327.
- Project management and accounting in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment version 10.0.41.

## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

There are no modifications to Dual-write maps in the Project Operations December 2024 release.

For a current list and versions of Project Operations dual-write maps, see [Project Operations dual-write map versions](../environment/resource-dual-write-maps.md).

Always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and Finance solution version. Some features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map isn't activated. You can view the active version of the map in the **Version** column on the **Dual-write** page. To activate a new version of the map, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and then save the selected version. If you customized an out-of-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue when you start the map, follow the instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual-write troubleshooting guide.
