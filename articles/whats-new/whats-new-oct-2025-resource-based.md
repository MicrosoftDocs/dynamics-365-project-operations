## Project Operations dual-write map updates

No updates for Project Operations dual-write maps in this release. For the current list of Project Operations dual-write maps and versions, see [Project Operations dual-write map versions](../environment/resource-dual-write-maps.md).

Run the latest version of the map and enable all related table maps when you update your Project Operations Dataverse and Finance solutions. Some features might not work if you don't activate the latest map version. View the active map version in the **Version** column on the **dual-write** page. To activate a new version, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and save it. If you customized an out-of-box table map, reapply those changes. Learn more in [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If the map doesn't start, see the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the dual-write troubleshooting guide.
