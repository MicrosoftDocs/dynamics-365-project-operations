# What's new July 2023 - Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

This article applies to the following components and versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations:

- Project Operations in a Microsoft Dataverse environment version 4.74.0.59
- Project management and accounting in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment version 10.0.34

## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

The following table shows the dual-write maps that have been modified or added in the Project Operations July 2023 release.

| Entity map | Updated version | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Operations integration actuals (msdyn_actuals) | 1.0.0.16 | This change ensures the transaction date doesn't shift in the situations when a user entering a transaction resides in the timezone different from UTC. The change only effects approved actuals following the activation of the new dual write map. Transactions that were created or processed prior to this update remains unaffected, and there won't be an impact or changes applied to them. |

Always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and Finance solution version. Some features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map isn't activated. You can view the active version of the map in the **Version** column on the **Dual-write** page. To activate a new version of the map, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and then save the selected version. If you've customized an out-of-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue when you start the map, follow the instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual-write troubleshooting guide.

## Features turned on by default in upcoming release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.36. Most features that have been automatically turned on can be turned off in [Feature management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview).
