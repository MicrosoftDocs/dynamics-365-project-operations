# What's new October 2023 - Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

This article applies to the following components and versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations:

- Project Operations in a Microsoft Dataverse environment version 4.87.0.188.
- Project management and accounting in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment version 10.0.36.

## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

There aren't any updates for Project Operations dual-write maps in this release. For a current list and versions of Project Operations dual-write maps, see [Project Operations dual-write map versions](../environment/resource-dual-write-maps.md).

Always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and Finance solution version. Some features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map isn't activated. You can view the active version of the map in the **Version** column on the **Dual-write** page. To activate a new version of the map, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and then save the selected version. If you've customized an out-of-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue when you start the map, follow the instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual-write troubleshooting guide.

### Features deprecated/removed in this release

This section describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal from Project Operations in this release.

- A _removed_ feature is no longer available in the product.
- A _deprecated_ feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update. 

| Feature name | Reason for deprecation/removal | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Project management and accounting adjustment parameter for **Invoiced**|Transactions are much more difficult to audit if they're adjusted after they have been invoiced. This behavior causes confusion for the small number of users who use this functionality.|[Project management and accounting adjustment parameter for **Invoiced**](/dynamics365/project-operations/whats-new/removed-depreciated-features-project#project-management-and-accounting-adjustment-parameter-for-invoiced)|
|Project management and accounting **Allow for projects with multiple funding sources** parameter|This parameter was originally added before feature management was available. However, it's no longer required, because the functionality can now be safely enabled for sales orders and multiple funding sources. Multiple funding sources should now always be optionally configurable in the project contract.|[Project management and accounting **Allow for projects with multiple funding sources** parameter](/dynamics365/project-operations/whats-new/removed-depreciated-features-project#project-management-and-accounting-allow-for-projects-with-multiple-funding-sources-parameter)|

For more information, see [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Project Operation](/dynamics365/project-operations/whats-new/removed-depreciated-features-project#project-management-and-accounting-use-adjustment-date-as-new-project-date-parameter).
