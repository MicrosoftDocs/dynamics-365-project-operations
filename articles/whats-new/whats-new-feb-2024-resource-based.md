## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

The following table shows the modified or added Dual-write maps in the Project Operations February 2024 release.

### Vendor invoice lines Dual-write map update

As part of the 10.0.38 upgrade, a new iteration of the Dual-write map is added, version 1.0.0.6, specifically for vendor invoice lines. This updated version enables the execution of intercompany vendor invoices. To enable this feature, certain integration keys were modified. If the Dual-write map for vendor invoice lines ceases to function, following these steps.

1.  Navigate to **Data Management workspace**, and locate the Dual-write maps section.
2.  On the Action pane, select the **Integration key**.
3.  Select the **Project vendor invoice line** integration key.
4.  Remove **msdyn_owningcompany** from the integration key.
5.  Ensure that **msdyn_externalinvoiceline** remains the only field for the **Vendor invoice line integration** key.
   
For a current list and versions of Project Operations Dual-write maps, see [Project Operations dual-write map versions](/dynamics365/project-operations/environment/resource-dual-write-maps).

Always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and Finance solution version. Some features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map isn't activated. You can view the active version of the map in the **Version** column on the **Dual-write** page. To activate a new version of the map, select **Table map versions**, select the latest version, and then save the selected version. If you customized an out-of-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue when you start the map, follow the instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual-write troubleshooting guide.
