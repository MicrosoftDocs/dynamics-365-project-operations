The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations Approvals Agent aims to streamline the approval process for time, expense, and material transactions, leveraging a [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) Agent to provide an initial review of incoming time, expense, and material entries against customer uploaded policy documents for each type of entry.
