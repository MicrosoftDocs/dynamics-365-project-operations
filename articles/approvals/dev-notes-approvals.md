_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Dynamics 365 Project Operations includes validation logic that ensures correct record transition through the approval stages. Correct record transitions ensure: 

  - All supporting rows are created in related tables, such as journals and actuals.
  - The approver is marked as a **Project Approver** in the project before proceeding.
