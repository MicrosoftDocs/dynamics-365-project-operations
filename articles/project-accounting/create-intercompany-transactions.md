# Create intercompany transactions

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Intercompany transactions are time and expense transactions from a project contract that belong to one company or organizational unit, while the resources on the project contract are part of a different company or organizational unit.

When an intercompany transaction is approved, the following actual transactions are created

| **Transaction type** | **Price list applied** | **Transaction currency** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | Contracting unit cost price list | Currency on the price line |
| Unbilled sales. These are created only for actuals that are associated with a contract line with the billing type, time, and material. | Contract project sales price list | Contract currency |
| Resourcing unit cost | Resourcing unit cost price list | Currency on the price line |
| Inter-organizational unit sales | Contracting unit cost price list | Currency on the price line |

Cost, resourcing unit cost, and inter-organizational unit sales transaction pricing and currency is driven by **organizational unit**. This is important to remember when deciding how to structure companies and organizational units in your implementation.

When you create opportunity, quote, project contract, and project records, the system verifies that the contracting unit's currency matches the contracting company's accounting currency. When they aren't the same, these records can't be created. The organizational unit currency is defined in Dynamics 365 Project Operations by going to **Dataverse** > **Settings** > **Organizational units**. A company's accounting currency is defined in Dynamics 365 Finance by going to **General ledger** > **Ledger setup** > **Ledger**. The currency is synchronized to your Dataverse environment using Ledgers Dual Write map.

The system creates resourcing unit cost and inter-organizational unit sales actuals  in the following situations:

  - When the resourcing unit differs from the contracting unit
  - When the resourcing company differs from contracting company

However, only transactions that have a different resourcing company from the contracting company will be transferred to the Dynamics 365 Finance environment for additional accounting.

Accounting for project actuals is recorded in the Project Operations integration journal in Finance. The system creates the following journal lines.

| **Transaction type** | **Legal entity** | **Creates project transaction on posting** | **Financial dimensions default from** | **Default billing sales tax group and billing item sales tax group** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | Doesn't get added to the integration journal | N\A | N\A | N\A |
| Unbilled sales | The borrowing legal entity integration journal | Yes | Project | **Billing sales tax group**: Based on the **contract customer** <br/> **Billing item sales tax group**: From the current legal entity project category on the journal line |
| Resourcing unit cost | Lending legal entity integration journal | No | Intercompany customer | **Billing sales tax group**: Based on the **intercompany customer** <br/> **Billing item sales tax group**: From the current legal entity project category on the journal line |
| Inter-organizational sales | Lending legal entity integration journal | No | Intercompany customer | **Billing sales tax group**: Based on the **intercompany customer** <br/> **Billing item sales tax group**: From the current legal entity project category on the journal line |

Molly Clark, developer employed in GBPM records 10 hours of work against a USPM Adventure Works project, which is approved by the project manager. Developer cost in GBPM is 88 GBP per hour. GBPM will bill USPM 120 USD per developer hour. USPM will bill the customer Adventure Works, 200 USD for work done by the GBPM resource.
