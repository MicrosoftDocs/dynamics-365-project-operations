# Date-effective price overrides 

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

*Date-effective price overrides* provide a way to override or change specific prices in the price list. For example, you have a standard price list that is effective from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. This price list has prices for many roles. The price that is set up for the **Network Technician** role is 100 US dollars (USD) per hour. When a network technician logs time between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, the time is priced at 100 USD. On October 1, 2022, you must adjust the price *only* for the **Network Technician** role, from 100 USD per hour to 110 USD per hour. The **Date effective price overrides** feature lets you set up this change as an override of the row for that specific role price. Therefore, you don't have to copy the whole price list and change the price of just that one row.

## Date-effective price overrides for labor pricing

The process of setting up date-effective price overrides for labor time on a project consists of two basic steps.

1. Enable **Date effective price overrides** feature.
1. Set up a date-effective price override.

### Enable the Date effective price overrides feature

> [!NOTE]
> After the **Date effective price overrides** feature is enabled, it can't be disabled.

To enable the **Date-effective price overrides** feature, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Settings** \> **Parameters**.
1. Open the **Parameters** record.
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Feature Control** tab, select **Enable date effective price overrides**.
1. In the confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.
1. After a few moments, refresh your browser. Date-effective price override capabilities should now be available. You will know that these capabilities have been enabled if **Enable date effective price overrides** no longer appears on the Action Pane.

### Set up a date-effective price override

Date-effective price overrides can be set up on **Cost**, **Sales**, or **Purchase** price lists.

> [!NOTE]
>The behavior of the **Date effective price overrides** currently has the following limitations:
>
> - Only role prices and role price markups support the **Date effective price overrides** feature in Project Operations.
> - When you copy a price list by using the **Copy** action on the **Price List details** page, and when you create a project price list from a standard or custom price list during contract creation, date-effective price overrides are **not** copied from the source price list.

To set up a date-effective price override for a role price or a role price markup, follow these steps.

1. Open the page for the price list that you want to set up the date-effective price override for.
1. Select the **Role prices** tab. This tab lists all the **Role price** records in the price list.
1. Select the **Role price** record that you want to set up a new date-effective override price for, and then double-tap (or double-click) **Role price** to open the **Role price details** page.
1. Select the **Date effective overrides** tab. The grid on this tab lists all the date-effective price overrides for the selected **Role price** record.
1. On the toolbar above the grid, select **New role price override**. The **New role price override** slider opens.
1. Specify the effective-from date, the unit, and the new price for the price override. Then select **Save**, and close the form.

> [!NOTE]
> - A date-effective price override for a role price or a role price markup is applicable to the same combination of pricing dimension values that exists on the parent **Role price** or **Role price markup** row.
> - The date that is selected in the **Effective from** field should be within the effective dates of the parent price list. The price override will take effect on the date that is selected in the **Effective from** field and will apply until the end of the parent price list's end date. If you set up another date-effective price override for the same role price, the first price override will take effect on the date that is selected in the **Effective from** field and will apply until the start of the second override.
