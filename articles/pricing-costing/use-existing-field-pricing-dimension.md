# Project Operations fields as pricing dimensions

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

The **Actuals** entity has many fields that can be used as pricing dimensions for resource-based pricing. For example, one common field is **Bookable Resource**. Smaller companies that have fewer than 20-30 billable resources may find that having bill and cost rates specific to each resource is a simpler approach. However, as the billable workforce grows, resource-specific rates could become unrealistic to maintain. Resource cost and bill rates begin to vary as resources get promoted, gain more experience, or acquire a different set of skills. 

Another example is that of transaction category. Customers and Implementers have used the transaction category to classify work and use the field to price and cost based on the category of work.
