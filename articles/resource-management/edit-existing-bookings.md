# Edit Bookings

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_


When changes occur on a project that require you to update existing bookings, there are several ways to make the changes. This article outlines how to update and make changes to bookings.

## Resource reconciliation

From the **Resource reconciliation** view, you can view the differences between the work assigned to a resource against the bookings allocated to the resource. In instances where there are more assignments than bookings, you can use the **Resource reconciliation** grid to extend the bookings. This action lets you create new bookings to cover any shortage that is highlighted in the view.

## Maintain bookings

From the **Team Member** grid, a Project manager can highlight a specific resource and select **Maintain Bookings** to open a filtered view of the Schedule Board. The view focuses on the bookings allocated for the specified resource on the relevant project. From this view, the Project manager can extend, shorten, or move the bookings with increased granularity compared to the **Extend Bookings** option. The Project manager can also substitute resources.

## Schedule Board

From the **Schedule Board**, the Resource manager has a portfolio view of all bookings across an organization. From this view, the Resource manager can extend, shorten, or move existing bookings similar to the capabilities offered in **Maintain Bookings**. The Resource manager can also substitute existing resources allocated to a specific booking by right-clicking the booking, and selecting **Substitute Resource**. Resource managers can also edit the contours of existing bookings by right-clicking the booking and selecting **Edit**.
