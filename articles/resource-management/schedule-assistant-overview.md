# Schedule assistant overview

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

The Schedule assistant is used to book resources based on requirements defined by the Project manager. The schedule assistant relies on the parameters provided in the resource requirement to find the resource. The Schedule assistant recommends resources that match relevant requirements, like time windows or skills needed.

After suitable resources are identified, the Resource or Project manager can book the resource to the work.

## Prerequisites

The Schedule assistant is a part of the Universal Resource Scheduling solution. This solution is included and installed with Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Matching requirements and resources

A generated resource requirement is based on details such as:

-   Characteristics
-   Roles
-   Business units
-   Resource preferences
-   Effort contours
-   Time zone

The Schedule assistant uses these details to filter resources.

## Launch the Schedule assistant

There are two ways in which the schedule assistant is launched. If you're using the hybrid mode, in the team member grid you can select any team member with an unfulfilled resource requirement, and then select **Book**. If you're using the central mode, the Resource manager finds and selects the resource.

## Schedule assistant filters

After the Schedule assistant runs, the details from the resource requirement are displayed as filtered values in the left pane. The Resource manager or the Project manager can fine-tune results by adjusting filters to meet the scheduling needs.

The filter pane shows work-related options, including:

-   Work start and end
-   Characteristics
-   Roles
-   Organizational units
-   Resourcing company
-   Resource types
-   Preferred resources
