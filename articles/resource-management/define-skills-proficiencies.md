# Define skills and proficiencies

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Skills are resource characteristics that are shared between Dynamics 365 Project Operations and if present, Dynamics 365 Field Service. 

- To maintain the repository of skills in Project Operations, go to **Resources** \> **Resource Skills**. 

## Use proficiency models to rate resources

Skills for resources are rated by proficiency models. The individual ratings are in a proficiency model. 

1. To create a proficiency model, go to **Resources** \> **Proficiency Models**, and then select **New**.
2. In the new rating model, specify the minimum rating value, the maximum rating value, and the entity that is being rated.
3. In the **Rating Values** subgrid, you can define the different rating values, from the minimum to the maximum.


These rating values are shown on the **Resource Requirements**, **Schedule Board**, and **Schedule Assistant** filters.
