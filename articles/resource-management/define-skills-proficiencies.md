# Define skills and proficiencies

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Skills are resource characteristics that Dynamics 365 Project Operations shares with Dynamics 365 Field Service, if it's present.

- To maintain the repository of skills in Project Operations, go to **Resources** \> **Resource Skills**.

## Use proficiency models to rate resources

Proficiency models rate skills for resources. An individual rating is part of a proficiency model.

1. To create a proficiency model, go to **Resources** \> **Proficiency Models**, and then select **New**.
1. In the new rating model, specify the minimum rating value, the maximum rating value, and the entity that you're rating.
1. In the **Rating Values** subgrid, define the different rating values, from the minimum to the maximum.

The system shows these rating values on the **Resource Requirements**, **Schedule Board**, and **Schedule Assistant** filters.
