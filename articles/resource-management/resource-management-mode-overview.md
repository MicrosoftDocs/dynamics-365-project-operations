# Resource management modes overview

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_


Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports two modes in order for you to execute the overall booking flow. The mode of management is defined as a project parameter and can be modified if your business needs change.    

## Central mode
For organizations who centralize the allocation for resources to projects, the Central mode provides a way to ensure Project managers can define resource requirements at the project level. Fulfillment of the resource requirements is delegated to a Resource manager. Project managers can accept or reject resources that are proposed by the Resource manager.

To manage resources with the Central mode, see:

- [Assign generic bookable resources to a task and generate resource requirements](/dynamics365/project-service/assign-generic-bookable-resource)
- [Book named resources from resource requirements](/dynamics365/project-service/book-named-resource)
- [Submit a resource request](/dynamics365/project-service/submit-resource-request)
- [Fulfill a resource request](/dynamics365/project-service/resource-management-fulfill-requests)
- [Accept or reject a proposed project resource from a resource request](/dynamics365/project-service/accept-reject-proposed-resource)

## Hybrid mode
For organizations who require flexibility in the allocation of resources, the hybrid mode enables both Project managers and Resource managers the ability to book resources.

In addition to the supported Central mode process, see the following articles to manage all other supported booking flows in the Hybrid mode:

Book a resource directly to a project:
- [Book named bookable resources to a project team and assign tasks](/dynamics365/project-service/assign-named-bookable-resource)

Book a resource from a resource requirement:
- [Assign generic bookable resources to a task and generate resource requirements](/dynamics365/project-service/assign-generic-bookable-resource)
- [Book named resources from resource requirements](/dynamics365/project-service/book-named-resource)
