# Define roles

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core._

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can define the roles or categories that are used to group the resources in your organization. For example, to identify groups of resources and define their pricing based on their roles, create categories such as **Consultant**, **Developer**, and **Project manager**, **Consulting Lead 1** and **Consulting Lead 2**, or **Senior Project manager**.

## Create a new role

To create a new role, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Resources** \> **Settings** \> **Roles**.
1. Select **New** to create a role.
1. Enter a name and description for the new role.
1. Optional: Add a target utilization and billing type. This information is then entered by default from the role to any resource that the role assigned to.
1. Optional: Assign skills to the role.
1. Select **Save** to save the newly defined role (characteristic).
