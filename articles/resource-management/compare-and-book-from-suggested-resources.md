## Shortlist resources to narrow down suggestions

The suggested resources are shown on two tabs: **Suggested** and **Shortlisted**. By default, the **Shortlisted** tab is empty, and all suggestions appear on the **Suggested** tab. To shortlist resources that meet the staffing criteria, follow one of these steps on the **Suggested** tab.

- Select **View details** for a resource. In the details view, use the **Shortlist** button to add a resource to the **Shortlisted** tab. You can go to other resources by using the **Next** and **Previous** buttons.

You're redirected to the **schedule board**, where you can review information about the resources' availability and use it to make the final booking decision.

For more information about how to use the schedule board to book a resource, see [Book from the schedule board](/dynamics365/project-operations/resource-management/book-project#book-from-the-schedule-board).
