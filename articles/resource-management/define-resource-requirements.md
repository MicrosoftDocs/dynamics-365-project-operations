# Define resource requirements

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Resource requirements are defined by the Project manager to establish the resources needed to execute the work on the project. Complete the following steps to define a resource requirement.

1.  In the **Work breakdown structure**, create one or more tasks.
2.  Assign a generic team member to each task. The assignments will update the total effort of the project team member.
3.  On the **Team Member** tab, select the team member and then select **Generate Requirement**.

For information about how to modify the resource requirement, see [Update Resource requirement details](define-resource-requirements.md) to modify the resource requirement.
