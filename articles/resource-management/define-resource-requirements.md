# Define resource requirements

The project manager defines resource requirements to specify the resources needed to complete the project work. Follow these steps to define a resource requirement.

1. In the **Work breakdown structure**, create one or more tasks.
1. Assign a generic team member to each task. The assignments update the total effort for the project team member.
1. On the **Team Member** tab, select the team member, and then select **Generate Requirement**.
