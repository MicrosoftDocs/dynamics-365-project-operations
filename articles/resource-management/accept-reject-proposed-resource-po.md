# Accept or reject a proposed project resource

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Core deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

This article provides information about how to approve or reject a proposed project resource.

When a Resource Manager proposes a named resource to fill the generic resource request for a project, the **Request Status** field for the generic team member is be updated to **Needs Review**. The request is sent to the project manager for approval or rejection.

The grid on the **Proposed Resources** tab on the **Project Team Member** page shows the proposed resourceâ€™s current bookings. After the proposal is accepted, the grid is updated to reflect that booking. 

To accept the proposed resource and book that resource on your team, click **Accept Proposals**.  
To reject the proposal, click **Reject Resource**.

Similar to directly fulfilling a generic resource request with a named resource, the generic resource is replaced and the assigned tasks is updated with the named team member.
