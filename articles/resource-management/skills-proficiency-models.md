# Skills and certifications
_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Characteristics are used to enrich the attributes used to describe the abilities of a resource. Each characteristic of a resource can be described as a **Skill** or a **Certification**.

Adding characteristics to resource requirements lets you document the knowledge or expertise needed by a resource to complete tasks on a project. Characteristics let you filter the list of available resources to those resources that have the required characteristics when scheduling the resource requirement.

## Add characteristics

1. From the main menu, open **Resources** and in the **Resources** section, select **Skills**.
2. Select **New** to add characteristics.
3. Fill in the required fields and select the **Characteristic Type**.

## Assign characteristics to resources

1. From the main menu, select **Resources** > **Bookable Resources**. The **Active Bookable Resources** page opens and you can view a list of all available resources in the system.
2. From the list, select the name of a bookable resource.
3. In the **Project Service** section, select **+Add Bookable Resource Characteristics record**.
4. In the pop-up window that opens, find and select the required characteristics, and add a **Rating Value** for the resource.
5. Select **Save & Close**.

## Assign characteristics to resource requirements

1. In the team member grid, find and double-click the generic team member with the characteristics that need to be updated.
2. In the **Project Team member Detail**, select the **Resource Requirement** tab.
