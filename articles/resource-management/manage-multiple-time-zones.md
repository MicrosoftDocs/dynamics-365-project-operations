# Manage time zones

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_


## Projects

When a project is created, the time zone is based on the time zone defined in the applied work hour template. On the **Project** for, the dates are always relative to the time zone of the user that is logged in on each tab, except the **Task** tab. When you view the work breakdown structure, the dates will always be displayed in the project’s time zone.

## Tasks

When a task is created, the start time, end time, and hours/day is controlled by the working hours of the project. For example, if a task is created with a project whose time zone is -8 PST and has the following working hours: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday to Friday, any task created without an assignment will respect the start time and end time of the project calendar.

## Manage resources with time zones

For accurate and predictable results when using **Extend Booking**, there are two key prerequisites that must be met:  

- The user must configure their device's time zone to match the time zone defined in the system's **Personalization Settings**.

- The bookable resource must have at least one minute of working time that overlaps with the contours that are used to define the requested extension. For example, the following resources with working hours that fall between 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM.

The following table shows:

- A project calendar template
- Resource A: This resource has the same calendar and is in the same time zone as the project. The start time of the bookings will be 9:00 AM.
- Resource B: This resource is located in a different time zone than the project and starts at 7:00 AM in their time zone. However, the bookings will begin at 9:00 AM as that is the earliest start time of the assignment contour.
- Resources C and D: The resources are located in different time zones, both different from each other and the project, and their bookings start no earlier than their respective available start times.

|Entity  |Calendar  |

|Project calendar template   | ![project calendar.](media/reconcile-assignments-06.png) |
|Resource A  | ![Resource A calendar.](media/reconcile-assignments-06.png) |
|Resource B  |  ![Resource B calendar.](media/reconcile-assignments-07.png) |
|Resource C  |  ![Resource C calendar.](media/reconcile-assignments-08.png) |
|Resource D  | ![Resource D calendar.](media/reconcile-assignments-09.png)  |
 
When you navigate to the **Reconciliation** view, the resource assignments and the associated booking shortages are displayed.

After the extend booking functionality has been used for each resource, bookings are successfully extended for each resource because each resource’s working hours overlapped with the contours of the shortage.

Notice that a closer look at the details of the bookings shows differences in the start time of the bookings. The bookings start no earlier than the start time of the assignment contour and no earlier than the available start time of the resource.
