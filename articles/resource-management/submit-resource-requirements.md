# Submit a resource request

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Core deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

You can submit a generated resource requirement as a resource request. The request is then sent to a Resource Manager for fulfillment.

1. In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, on the **Projects** page, select the **Team** tab to view a list of bookable resources. 
2. Select the generic resource that has a resource requirement from the list, and then click **Submit Request**.

The request status of the generic team member will change to **Submitted**.

The recipient of the resource request has the ability to either partially fullfill the request using one or more resources, or completely fulfill the resource request.

After the request is fulfilled, one or more named resources are added to the project as project team members. If the resource requirement is fulfilled by one resource, the generic team member associated with the resource request is deleted. 

After the recipient of the resource request has proposed resources and is ready for the Project Manager to review the resources who have been proposed, they should update the status of the resource request to **Needs Review**.
