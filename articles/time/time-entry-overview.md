# Time overview

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Time entry is the process of recording the actual time that a resource consumes. By using time entries in Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can calculate cost and sales prices as tasks progress. These entries help the project manager keep on top of projects and tasks. Time entries also notify resource managers of any potential vacation or absences that appear on the schedule board as **Out**. These notifications allow the resource managers to plan around those events.

When recording time in Project Operations, users can track against any level in the project. This tracking includes the task, summary, or project level.

Project team members create and submit time entries for approval, and the project approvers approve the entries. The project team member might recall a time entry for corrections.

For information about how to create, submit, or recall an entry, and other tools to help complete your reporting, see [Time entry user behavior](ui-behavior-time.md).
