# Start using the Time Entry Agent as a Team Member

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

After a team member has set up their agent preferences as detailed in the previous section, from then on the experience of logging time entries will look like this:
- Agent creates Draft time entries for the user at the start of a week
- User receives an alert on Teams from the agent summarising entries created
- User reviews created time entries either in Teams or on the Project Operations web app
- Modifies entries if required and submits for approval

These steps and the behaviour of the Time Entry Agent are explained below.
