# Using the Time Entry Agent as a Team Member

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

Once all steps to [enable the time entry agent for end users](enable-time-entry-agent.md) have been completed by a system administrator, team members can now start using the agent. The interface used by the agent to communicate with team members is via MS Teams, as a Teams app. To begin using the agent through Teams, each user must first:
- Add the "Time Entry Agent (Preview)" Teams app, then
- Give consent to the agent for time entry creation and set certain preferences 

## Add the Time Entry Agent (Preview) Teams App

When your organisation has enabled the agent and shared it with you, the agent can be accessed as a Teams app by following these steps:
1. Navigate to your MS Teams app or Teams in the browser using the same credentials used to log into your Project Operations environment.
2. Navigate to the **Apps** section within Teams.
3. You will find the **Time Entry Agent (Preview)** app either under _Built for your organisation_ or _Added by your org_ sections. Select the **Add** button for this app.
4. A pop-up may appear with more details about the app, proceed to **Add** it.
5. Once added, the option to **Open** the app will be available. Click **Open**. This takes you to a Teams chat where all interactions with the Time Entry Agent will occur.

After adding this app, the next step involves giving consent to allow the agent to create time entries on your behalf.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reach out to your system administrator if this app is not visible under your Teams apps.

## Give consent to the agent and set preferences
 
On opening the Teams app, you must ideally receive a message titled as "Logging Time made easy" (see image).

If this message does not come up automatically the first time you're using the app, you may send **Agent user preferences** or **Agent settings** as a message in chat. This will load the expected message.

Follow these steps to provide the agent with consent.
- Select **Get Started** on the initial message.
- You'll be asked if you'd like to allow the agent to create time entries on your behalf. Select **Yes**.

You have now provided the agent with consent to generate time entries for you, and will be shown 4 more configurable settings that are required to decide how the agent goes about creating these entries and sending you alerts.
