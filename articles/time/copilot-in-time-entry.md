# Use Copilot in time entry (preview)

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

Copilot in time entry is designed to simplify the time entry experience and take away the drudgery of navigating endless forms, drop-down lists that currently make this process time consuming. This gives back time to project team members that they can instead use for more high leverage tasks.

This Copilot feature currently has two primary capabilities:

- Log my time
- Generate external comments

## Enable or disable the Copilot in time entry feature

This feature is currently in preview state and **can only be accessed on environments hosted in the "NAM" Azure region**. Please confirm with your tenant admin before trying to access this feature.

To enable Copilot in time entry, follow these steps.
