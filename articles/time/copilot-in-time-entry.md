Copilot in time entry is designed to simplify the time entry experience and take away the drudgery of navigating endless forms, drop-down lists that currently make this process time consuming. This gives back time to project team members that they can instead use for more high leverage tasks.

This Copilot feature currently has two primary capabilities:

- Log my time
- Generate external comments

## Enable or disable the Copilot in time entry feature
