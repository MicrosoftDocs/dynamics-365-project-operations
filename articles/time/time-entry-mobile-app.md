# Time Entry Mobile App (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

## Introduction

The Dynamics 365 Time Entry mobile app now allows users with a valid Team Member license to continue and complete their time tracking on-the-go. This app is developed by using a Microsoft Power Apps canvas app and can be accessed by users from the Power Apps mobile app.

This mobile app can be used to:
- Create and submit new time entries from scratch,
- Review time entries that were previously submitted or created as a draft,
- Get visibility into projects and tasks that the user is currently assigned to,
- View a weekly summary of time entries logged in the form of charts and
- Use an **all-new timer** functionality to record dedicated periods of work and turn them into time entries

Since this app is currently released as a **Production Ready Preview**, it must be “shared” with users in an organisation by system administrators, before it can be used to log time entries. 

## Views introduced in this app

This mobile app primarily has 4 views or pages that team members can interact with to log their time entries. These views and their contents are summarised below.

### My Time

- This is the default landing page on initial load of the app
- It consists of a day-wise list of time entries, with a summary of hours submitted or approved for that day
- Users can navigate across days of each work week (the start and end of a work week is based on user's personalisation settings)
- Users can also switch between weeks using the arrow keys or calendar control on the top-right
- A “+” (new time entry) icon at the bottom allows users to create a new entry from scratch using the quick create form

### My Work

- This view provides users with a list of Projects and Project Tasks to which they are currently assigned.
- Details like _Role_, _End Date of Assignment_ and _Hours Logged_ are provided for every assigned task to help users keep track of their work streams.
