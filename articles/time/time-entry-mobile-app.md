# Time Entry Mobile App (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing._

## Introduction

The Dynamics 365 Time Entry mobile app now allows users with a valid Team Member license to continue and complete their time tracking on-the-go. This app is developed by using a Microsoft Power Apps canvas app and can be accessed by users from the Power Apps mobile app.

This mobile app can be used to:
- Create and submit new time entries from scratch,
- Review time entries that were previously submitted or created as a draft,
- Get visibility into projects and tasks that the user is currently assigned to,
- View a weekly summary of time entries logged in the form of charts and
- Use an **all-new timer** functionality to record dedicated periods of work and turn them into time entries

Since this app is currently released as a **Production Ready Preview**, it must be “shared” with users in an organisation by system administrators, before it can be used to log time entries. Please review the next section to understand how to enable this app for team member users in your organisation.
