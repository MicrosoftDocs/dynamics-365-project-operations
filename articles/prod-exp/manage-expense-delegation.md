# Manage expense delegation

An expense delegate can create and manage expense reports for another employee.

## Configure expense delegation

1. To set up a user as an expense delegate, go to **Expense management > Setup > General > Delegates**.
2. On the **Delegates** page, select **New**.
3. Select the employee that will have a delegate defined. 
4. Enter the alias of the delegate user and the start and end date for the delegation period.

## Manage expense delegation for another employee

When the feature management key **Enable expense delegates list page** is enabled, the **Expenses delegated to me** list page will be available. Go to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expenses delegated to me**.

A delegate user can quickly filter and search on existing expense reports that have been delegated to them. They can also create a new expense report for other users by selecting **New expense report**.

Delegate users can also create and manage expense reports for other employees by going to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expense reports** and selecting **Open other user's expenses**.
