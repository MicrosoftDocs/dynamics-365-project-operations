# View an expense report from General ledger or Procurement and sourcing

When you run a query to view transactions in General ledger or Procurement and sourcing, the query might return too much information. Therefore, you might want to narrow your search. To get the information that you require, you can drill down into a transaction to see the expense report that it appeared on.

For expense reports, you can drill down from a transaction to the original report that is stored in Expense management. In addition to the total amount of expenses, you can view the itemized transactions, the transactions that are eligible for recovery of value-added tax (VAT), and the receipts that are attached to the expenses.

To drill down to the original expense report that a transaction appeared on, select the transaction, and then select **Original document**.

When you view individual transactions, you can also view any additional data that is attached to a transaction. For example, for an itemized hotel expense, you can view a detailed list of expenses such as internet access, telephone calls, and room service.
