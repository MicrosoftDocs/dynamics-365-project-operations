Employees can easily submit expense reports directly within the Dynamics 365 platform. They can capture receipts, categorize expenses, and add relevant details such as project codes or client names.

## Approval workflows

Organizational policies can route expense reports through customizable approval workflows. Approvers can review, approve, reject, or request further information on expense submissions.

## Policy compliance

The system helps enforce company expense policies by flagging violations such as out-of-policy expenses or noncompliant receipts. This feature ensures adherence to spending guidelines and regulatory requirements.

## Integration

Dynamics 365 Expense Management seamlessly integrates with other modules within the Dynamics 365 ecosystem, such as Finance and Human Resources, enabling a unified view of financial data and employee information.

## Mobile accessibility

Employees can conveniently submit expenses on-the-go by using the mobile app. It allows them to capture receipts, submit reports, and track reimbursement status from their smartphones or tablets.

## Analytics and reporting

The platform provides robust reporting and analytics capabilities, allowing finance teams to gain insights into spending patterns, identify cost-saving opportunities, and track key performance metrics related to expense management.
