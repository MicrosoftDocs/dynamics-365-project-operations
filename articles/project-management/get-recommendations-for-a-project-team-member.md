# Get recommendations for a project team member

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

## Get suggested resources 

Follow these steps to begin using recommended resources for a project team member:

1. Ensure you have completed the [prerequisites for using resource recommendations](./getting-started-with-resource-recommendations.md).
2. Navigate to **Projects** > **Select a project** that needs to be staffed with one or more resources.
3. Go to the **Team** tab to view the list of team members on this project.
4. Select any one team member row 

Navigate to project, select one team member row (do not select multiple team members together), you will see a **Suggest Resources** button next to Subcontracting Options

## View more details

This can be done in two ways: 1) Select any one suggested resource and click **View Details** OR 2) Click the information icon next to any resource's name.
You can navigate to other resources from this view using the **Next** and **Previous** buttons.

## Narrow down list of suggestions

Select one or more resources and click **Shortlist**. This resource will now appear in the **Shortlisted** tab, where more resources can be similarly added.

## Continue to book suggested resource

Once you have narrowed down your list to the desired number of resources, navigate to **Shortlisted** tab and select **Continue Booking**.
This creates a new resource requirement or updates an existing requirement and re-directs you to the **Schedule Board**, where information about the resources' availability will be visible to make the final booking decision.
For more information on using the **Schedule Board** to book a resource, please refer to [this page]()
