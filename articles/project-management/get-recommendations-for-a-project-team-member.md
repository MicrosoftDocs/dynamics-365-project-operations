_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

## Get suggested resources 

Follow these steps to begin using recommended resources for a project team member:

1. Ensure you have completed the [prerequisites for using resource recommendations](./getting-started-with-resource-recommendations.md).
2. Navigate to **Projects** > **Select a project** that needs to be staffed with one or more resources.
3. Go to the **Team** tab to view the list of team members on this project.
4. Select any one team member row that is not already booked with a named resource. _(Do not select more than one row at a time)_
5. A new **Suggest Resources** button will appear next to **Subcontracting Options**. Click this button.
6. A loading screen will appear and after a few seconds, the list of recommended resources will be displayed within the side-pane. 


## View more details to evaluate suggested resources

Each suggested resource is assigned a **recommendation score** _(out of 10)_ to signify their appropriateness to that particular team member requirement. This score is currently based only on how relevant their past experience on projects is to a team member requirement, this will be augmented to include additional factors _(Cost, Availability, Utilisation & Skill-match in upcoming releases)_. The suggested resources are sorted in decreasing order of this score.

To get more information about a suggested resource and interpret their recommendation score, follow any one of these two steps:

1. Directly click the **information icon** next to any resource's name OR
2. Select any one suggested resource rows through the grid and then click **View Details** button.

This displays additional information related to past experience of that resource. The metrics being displayed are summarised below:

Once you have narrowed down your list to the desired number of resources, navigate to **Shortlisted** tab and select **Continue Booking**.
