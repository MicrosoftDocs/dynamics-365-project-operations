# Collaboration with Office Groups

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

By using Office Groups, you can share a project with other team members in the Common Data Service. When you add users to the group, the group takes ownership of the project. All users get edit permission on the project. Users can also see the project if the administrator grants them privileges. These users don't appear in the group.

> [!NOTE]
> Users are added to the group only if you select **Groups** and add them. This step is different from the behavior of Project for the Web.
