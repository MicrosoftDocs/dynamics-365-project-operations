# Collaboration with Office Groups

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Core deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_



Office Groups allow you to share a project with other team members in the Common Data Service. When you add users to the group, project ownership transfers to the group. All users will have edit permission on the project. Users may also see the project if privileges have been granted by the administrator. These users won't be displayed in the group.

> [!NOTE] 
> Users are only added to the group if you press **Groups** and add them. This is different to the behaviour of Project for the Web.
