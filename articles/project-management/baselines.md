# Set up baselines

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

With Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can quickly set up baselines to compare your plan with the actual progress on the project. You can now create a baseline for your project before the execution of the project.

## Set a baseline for your project

To set a baseline for your project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project for which you want to set a baseline.
1. Go to the task tab.
1. Select the **Baseline** icon to start the setup.
1. Select the **Create Baseline** button.
1. **Baseline Details** shows the project level insights.

## Perform a task level comparison

To perform a task level comparison, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Baseline** icon.
1. Select **Spotlight** and task level insights are presented.
1. Select **Compare all tasks**. Three new columns are added to the task grid.
1. You can now compare your **baseline start** and **baseline finish** dates with planned **start** and planned **finish** dates and see the **variance**.

## Delete a baseline

To delete a baseline, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Baseline** icon.
1. Select the **"..."** icon and select **Delete Baseline**.
