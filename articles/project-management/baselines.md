# Baselines

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

With Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can quickly setup baselines to compare your plan with the actual progress on the project. You can now create a baseline for your project before the execution of the project.

## Set a baseline for your project

1. Open the project for which you want to set a baseline.
2. Navigate to the task tab.
3. Select the **Baseline** icon to start the setup.
4. Select the **Create Baseline** button.
5. **Baseline Details** shows the project level insights.

## Task level comparison
1. Select the **Baseline** icon.
2. Select **Spotlight** and task level insights are presented.
3. Select **Compare all tasks**. This will add 3 new columns to the task grid.
4. You can now compare your **baseline start** and **baseline finish** dates with planned **start** and planned **finish** dates and see the **variance**.

## Delete a baseline

1. Select the **Baseline** icon.
2. Select the **"..."** icon and select **Delete Baseline**.
