# Use Project schedule APIs to perform operations with Scheduling entities

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_



## Scheduling entities

Project schedule APIs provide the ability to perform create, update, and delete operations with **Scheduling entities**. These entities are managed through the Scheduling engine in Project for the web. Create, update, and delete operations with **Scheduling entities** were restricted in earlier Dynamics 365 Project Operations releases.

The following table provides a full list of the Project schedule entities.

| Entity name  | Entity logical name |
| --- | --- |
| Project | msdyn_project |
| Project Task  | msdyn_projecttask  |
| Project Task Dependency  | msdyn_projecttaskdependency  |
| Resource Assignment | msdyn_resourceassignment |
| Project Bucket  | msdyn_projectbucket |
| Project Team Member | msdyn_projectteam |

## OperationSet

OperationSet is a unit-of-work pattern that can be used when several schedule impacting requests must be processed within a transaction.

## Project schedule APIs

The following is a list of current Project schedule APIs.

- **msdyn_CreateProjectV1**: This API can be used to create a project. The project and default project bucket are created immediately.
- **msdyn_CreateTeamMemberV1**: This API can be used to create a project team member. The team member record is created immediately.
- **msdyn_CreateOperationSetV1**: This API can be used to schedule several requests that must be performed within a transaction.
- **msdyn_PssCreateV1**: This API can be used to create an entity. The entity can be any of the Project scheduling entities that support the create operation.
- **msdyn_PssUpdateV1**: This API can be used to update an entity. The entity can be any of the Project scheduling entities that support the update operation.
- **msdyn_PssDeleteV1**: This API can be used to delete an entity. The entity can be any of the Project scheduling entities that support the delete operation.
- **msdyn_ExecuteOperationSetV1**: This API is used to execute all of the operations within the given operation set.

## Using Project schedule APIs with OperationSet

Because records with both **CreateProjectV1** and **CreateTeamMemberV1** are created immediately, these APIs can't be used in the **OperationSet** directly. However, you can use the API to create needed records, create an **OperationSet**, and then use these pre-created records in the **OperationSet**.

## Supported operations

| Scheduling entity | Create | Update | Delete | Important considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Project task | Yes | Yes | Yes | The **Progress**, **EffortCompleted**, and **EffortRemaining** fields can be edited in Project for the Web, but they can't be edited in Project Operations.  |
| Project task dependency | Yes |  | Yes | Project task dependency records aren't updated. Instead, an old record can be deleted, and a new record can be created. |
| Resource assignment | Yes | Yes | | Operations with the following fields aren't supported: **BookableResourceID**, **Effort**, **EffortCompleted**, **EffortRemaining**, and **PlannedWork**. Resource assignment records aren't updated. Instead, the old record can be deleted, and a new record can be created. |
| Project bucket | Yes | Yes | Yes | The default bucket is created by using the **CreateProjectV1** API. Support for creating and deleting project buckets was added in Update Release 16. |
| Project team member | Yes | Yes | Yes | For the create operation, use the **CreateTeamMemberV1** API. |
| Project | Yes | Yes |  | Operations with the following fields aren't supported: **StateCode**, **BulkGenerationStatus**, **GlobalRevisionToken**, **CalendarID**, **Effort**, **EffortCompleted**, **EffortRemaining**, **Progress**, **Finish**, **TaskEarliestStart**, and **Duration**. |

These APIs can be called with entity objects that include custom fields.

The ID property is optional. If it's provided, the system attempts to use it and throws an exception if it can't be used. If it isn't provided, the system will generate it.

## Restricted fields

The following tables define the fields that are restricted from **Create** and **Edit**.

## Limitations and known issues
The following is a list of limitations and known issues:

- Project Schedule APIs can only be used by **Users with Microsoft Project License**. They can't be used by:

    - Application users
    - System users
    - Integration users
    - Other users that don't have the required license

- Each **OperationSet** can only have a maximum of 100 operations.
- Each user can only have a maximum of 10 open **OperationSets**.
- Project Operations currently supports a maximum of 500 total tasks on a project.
- **OperationSet** failure status and failure logs aren't currently available.
- [Limits and boundaries on projects and tasks](/project-for-the-web/project-for-the-web-limits-and-boundaries)

## Error handling

- To review errors generated from the Operation Sets, go to **Settings** \> **Schedule Integration** \> **Operations Sets**.
- To review errors generated from the Project schedule Service, go to **Settings** \> **Schedule Integration** \> **PSS Error Logs**.

## Sample scenario

In this scenario, you will create a project, a team member, four tasks, and two resource assignments. Next, you will update one task, update the project, delete one task, delete one resource assignment, and create a task dependency.

```csharp
Entity project = CreateProject();
project.Id = CallCreateProjectAction(project);
var projectReference = project.ToEntityReference();

var teamMember = new Entity("msdyn_projectteam", Guid.NewGuid());
teamMember["msdyn_name"] = $"TM {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}";
teamMember["msdyn_project"] = projectReference;
var createTeamMemberResponse = CallCreateTeamMemberAction(teamMember);

var description = $"My demo {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}";
var operationSetId = CallCreateOperationSetAction(project.Id, description);

var task1 = GetTask("1WW", projectReference);
var task2 = GetTask("2XX", projectReference, task1.ToEntityReference());
var task3 = GetTask("3YY", projectReference);
var task4 = GetTask("4ZZ", projectReference);

var assignment1 = GetResourceAssignment("R1", teamMember, task2, project);
var assignment2 = GetResourceAssignment("R2", teamMember, task3, project);

var task1Response = CallPssCreateAction(task1, operationSetId);
var task2Response = CallPssCreateAction(task2, operationSetId);
var task3Response = CallPssCreateAction(task3, operationSetId);
var task4Response = CallPssCreateAction(task4, operationSetId);

var assignment1Response = CallPssCreateAction(assignment1, operationSetId);
var assignment2Response = CallPssCreateAction(assignment2, operationSetId);

task2["msdyn_subject"] = "Updated Task";
var task2UpdateResponse = CallPssUpdateAction(task2, operationSetId);

project["msdyn_subject"] = $"Proj update {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}";
var projectUpdateResponse = CallPssUpdateAction(project, operationSetId);

var task4DeleteResponse = CallPssDeleteAction(task4.Id.ToString(), task4.LogicalName, operationSetId);

var assignment2DeleteResponse = CallPssDeleteAction(assignment2.Id.ToString(), assignment2.LogicalName, operationSetId);

var dependency1 = GetTaskDependency(project, task2, task3);
var dependency1Response = CallPssCreateAction(dependency1, operationSetId);

CallExecuteOperationSetAction(operationSetId);
Console.WriteLine("Done....");
```
