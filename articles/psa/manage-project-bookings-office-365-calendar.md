[!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] 

View personal appointments, project-work bookings, and field service work order assignments using the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] calendar.  
  
 With everything in one place, it’s easy to manage your day. Your meetings, appointments, bookings, and tasks are all available in your [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] calendar.  
  
 If you’re using [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)], you can also enter your personal appointments in the Project Service time entry view. This lets project and resource managers know your availability for projects. It also saves you time, because you don’t have to enter info about your personal appointments twice. You can simply import your personal appointments from your calendar to Project Service time entry view.  
  
 Your calendar will sync project and work order bookings from today to upcoming four weeks. This setting can’t be changed.  
  
 Syncing is only supported one way, from PSA to your [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] calendar. You can sync in the reverse order. 
  
 To learn how to use your [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] calendar, see [Calendar in Outlook on the web for business](https://support.office.com/article/Calendar-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-5219c457-d1fe-4c2f-9032-1a816b88e936).
