# Create custom fields and entities 

[!include [banner](../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]

Complete the following steps any time that you want to create a custom option set or entity on the Power Apps platform.  
The procedures in this article should be completed using the web interface of Project Service Automation (PSA).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you make all custom pricing dimension changes in a separate solution. This important best practice provides flexibility in the future to update or remove changes as needed, will help with re-use of your work, and makes it easier to port these changes to another instance. After you have made all of the required changes, export this solution as a **Managed solution** and import it into other instances to reuse your pricing setup.

  
## Create custom fields and option sets in the pricing dimension solution

A pricing dimension can be an option set or an entity. Both must be created in your pricing solution. The steps in this procedure explain how to create entity-based dimensions and option set-based dimensions.

### Entity-based dimensions

1. In PSA, click **Settings** > **Solutions**, and then double-click **\<your organization name> pricing dimensions**.
2. In Solution Explorer, on the left navigation pane, select **Entities**.
3. Click **New** to create a new entity called **Standard Title**. Enter the remaining required information, and then click **Save**.

### Option set-based dimensions 
You can create two option set-based dimensions. Use **Resource Work Location** to track the price of **Home** location work and **Onsite** work and use **Resource Work hours** with values **Regular** and **Overtime** to apply a markup when work is completed.


1. In PSA, click **Settings** > **Solutions**, and then double-click  **\<your organization name> pricing dimensions**. 
2. In Solution Explorer, on the left navigation pane, select  **Option Sets**. 
3. Click **New** to create a new option set, enter the remaining required information, and then click **Save**.

## Create data for entity-based dimensions

You can create data for entity-based dimensions manually, or by using Microsoft Excel import or service calls. Use the steps in this procedure to create two standard titles, **Systems Engineer** and **Senior Systems Engineer** from the entity-based dimension, **Standard Title**. If the data that you want to create is small, as in the following example, you can use a standard form.

1. In PSA, click **Advanced Find**. Select the entity **Standard Title** and then click **Results**. All of the rows in the **Standard Title** entity will be shown.
2. Click **New**. In the **Name** field, enter "Systems Engineer" and then click **Save**.
3. Close the form. 
4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 to create another standard title for "Senior Systems Engineer".
