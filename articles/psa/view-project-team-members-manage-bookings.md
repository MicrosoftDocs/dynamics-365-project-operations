You can view a list of your project’s team members, and from there you can maintain bookings and submit resource requests.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click the project you want to work on.  
  
3.  In the bar across the top of the screen, select the down arrow next to the project name, and then click **Project Team Members**.  
  
4.  To submit resource requests, select the roles you want to request resources for, and then click **Submit Request**.  
  
5.  To hard book a resource instead, select the role, and then click **Hard Book**. This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability, with color coding that provides a visual view of a resource’s booking status. Do any of the following to optimize your search:  
  
    -   Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  
  
    -   Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  
  
    -   Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.  
  
    -   In the calendar for the resource you want to book, select the time period to book the resource, and then either click **Book** to book the resource or **Propose Booking** to propose the booking and have the requestor approve it.  
  
6.  To manage the resource bookings for this project, select the resources you want, and then click **Maintain Bookings**.  
  
7.  A resource manager needs to review and approve your resource requests.
