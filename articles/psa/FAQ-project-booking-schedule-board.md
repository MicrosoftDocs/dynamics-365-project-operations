# Create a project booking from the Schedule board

[!include [banner](../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]

You can book a resource onto a project directly from the **Team** tab of the project or by generating a resource requirement from a generic team member assignment and then fulfilling the generated requirement with a project team member.

You can also book a resource onto a project directly from the Schedule board. There are three ways to do this:

- **Book from a generated resource requirement:** You can generate a resource requirement after you create a generic resource and assign tasks within a project.

- **Book from the primary requirement:** The primary requirements show up on the Schedule board on the **Project** tab. 

- **Book from a new resource requirement:** You can create a resource requirement from scratch and associate it with a project. On the Schedule board, the resource requirement shows up on the **Open Requirements** tab.

## Book from a generated resource requirement

You can create a generic resource and assign it one or more tasks within a project. Then you can generate a resource requirement from the generic team member. 

1.  On the Schedule board, this resource will show up on the **Open Requirements** tab. You might need to use column filters on the grid if you have many open requirements.

2. Select the requirement. The **Find Availability** tab will appear at the top of the selected row.
 
3. When you select the tab, the Schedule Assistant mode of the Schedule board opens and then filters the available resources that meet the resource requirement. After that, you can book a resource.

4. You can also drag and drop the selected row from the bottom of the Schedule board to a resource cell in the grid above. When you drop it, it opens the **Create Resource Booking** panel on the right.

    Selecting **Book** books the resource onto the project team.

## Book from the Primary Requirement

Creating a project in Project Service automatically creates a resource requirement called the Primary Requirement. This is an empty requirement that is used to quickly book a resource with the Schedule board without generating a requirement or creating one from scratch. Because the requirement is empty, you’ll need to specify dates as well as the allocation method and hours, if applicable. 

1. To book a resource with the Primary Requirement, on the Schedule board, select the **Project** tab. You might need to use the column filter on the **Project** column if you have many projects.

2. Select the requirement that only has the project name as its name and has a duration of zero (0).

3. Select the **Find Availability** tab that appears on the row. This puts the Schedule board in Schedule Assistant mode and shows the available resources that can be booked onto the project.

4. Because a **Primary Requirement** is an empty requirement with zero (0) duration, you’ll need to set the duration on the **Create Resource Booking** panel when selecting and booking a resource.

5. You can also select the **Project Primary Requirement** at the bottom of the Schedule board and drag and drop it on a resource to book it.
 
    Because the **Primary Requirement** is an empty requirement that has zero (0) duration, you’ll need to set the duration on the **Create Resource Booking** panel when you select and book a resource.
 
    When you book a resource through the **Primary Requirement** on the Schedule board, you add it to the project team without any assignments.
 
## Book from a new resource requirement
Complete the following steps to book from a new resource requirement. 

1. Go to **Resource Requirements**, and then select **New** to create a new resource requirement.

2. On the **Project** tab, select a project to associate the requirement to the project.
 
    On the Schedule board, this new requirement shows as an **Open Requirement** that you can fulfill.

3. Book the resource to add it to the project team.

4. Now that the resource is booked, you must assign tasks manually.
