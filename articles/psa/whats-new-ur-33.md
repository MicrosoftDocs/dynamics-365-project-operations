The following issues have been fixed:

- Two locked fields, **msdyn_description** and **msdyn_externaldescription** are editable after submission.
- An error message occurs if an expense is created that isn't related to a project.
- When a time entry is created, the resource role defaults to an inactive role.
- Journal lines associated with a recalled and deleted expense aren't deleted.
- On the **Time entry Quick Create Form**, update the **Project Task List** view to change the date displayed by default to the start date of the task.
- When you create a time entry from the **Related** tab of the bookable resource, the time entry is incorrectly created for the signed-in user instead of the parent bookable resource.
- New fields are added to the **Bulk approval MDD** dialog box.

**Project planning**

The following issues have been fixed:
- Slow project creation performance when project work hour templates are applied with complex calendars.
- When the start date is greater than the end date, an error displays on the copy project template because of differences in the time component of each field.

- An incorrect parameter is used in the resource utilization query and the XML leads to incorrect filter results on the **Resource Utilization** grid.
- The **Extend Bookings** confirmation displays incorrect end date for bookings.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- An error message occurs if a contract line milestone is created without an order line.
