Your clients’ projects no doubt require a variety of different skills to complete the job, such as SQL programming or agile methodologies. Enter each skill so you can associate it with resource roles and resources later on.  
  
1. Go to **Project Service > Resource Skills**.  
  
2. Click **New**.  
  
3. In the **General** area, enter a name for the skill in Name, and then fill in the other fields as necessary.  
  
4. Click **Save**.  
  
   When you create a new skill, it’s automatically activated. If you don’t want this skill available for use yet, click **Deactivate** at the top of the screen. Then go back and activate it when you want to make it available.  
  
   In the next step, you’ll set up proficiency models so you can rate a consultant’s proficiency with each skill and match it to the proficiency a project requires.
