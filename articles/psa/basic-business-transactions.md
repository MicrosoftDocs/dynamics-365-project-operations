# Business transactions

In Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation, *business transaction* is an abstract concept that isn't represented by any entity. However, some common fields and processes on entities are designed to use the concept of business transactions. The following entities use this abstraction:

- Quote line details
- Contract line details
- Estimate lines
- Journal lines
- Actuals

Of these entities, Quote line details, Contract line details, and Estimate lines are mapped to the estimation phase in the project lifecycle. The Journal lines and Actuals entities are mapped to the execution phase in the project lifecycle.

PSA treats records in these five entities as business transactions. The only distinction is that records in entities that are mapped to the estimation phase are considered financial forecasts, whereas the records in entities that are mapped to the execution phase are considered financial facts that have already occurred.

For more information, see [Estimates](estimates.md) and [Actuals](actuals.md).

## Concepts that are unique to business transactions
The following concepts are unique to the concept of business transactions:

- Transaction type
- Transaction class
- Transaction origin
- Transaction connection

### Transaction type

Transaction type represents the timing and context of the financial impact on a project. It's represented by an option set that has the following supported values in PSA:
- Cost
- Project contract
- Unbilled sales
- Billed sales
- Inter organizational sales
- Resourcing unit cost

### Transaction class

Transaction class represents the different types of costs that are incurred on projects. It's represented by an option set that has the following supported values in PSA:

- Time
- Expense
- Material
- Fee
- Milestone
- Tax

The **Milestone** value is typically used by the business logic for fixed-price billing in PSA.

### Transaction origin

Transaction origin is an entity that stores the origin of each business transaction. As project execution gets underway, each business transaction will give rise to another business transaction which in turn will create another and so on. Transaction origin entity was designed to store data about each transactionâ€™s origin to help reporting and traceability. 

### Transaction connection

Transaction connection is an entity that stores the relation between two similar business transactions such as cost and related sales actuals or transaction reversals triggered by billing activities such invoice confirmation or invoice corrections.

Together, Transaction origin and Transaction connection help you keep track of relationships between business transactions and actions that resulted in the creation of a specific business transaction.

### Example: How Transaction origin works with Transaction connection

The following example shows the typical processing of time entries in a PSA project lifecycle.

> ![Processing time entires in a Project Service life cycle.](media/basic-guide-17.png)
 
1. Submission of a time entry causes the creation of two journal lines: one for cost and one for unbilled sales.
2. Eventual approval of the time entry causes the creation of two actuals: one for cost and one for unbilled sales.
3. When the user creates a project invoice, the invoice line transaction is created by using data from the unbilled sales actual. 
4. When the invoice is confirmed, two new actuals are created: an unbilled sales reversal and a billed sales actual.

Each of these events triggers the creation of records in the Transaction origin and Transaction connection entities to help build a trace of relationships between these records that are created across time entry, journal line, actuals, and invoice line details.

The following table shows the records in the Transaction origin entity for the preceding workflow.
