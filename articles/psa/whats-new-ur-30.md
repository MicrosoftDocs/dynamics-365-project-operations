## Update Release 30

### Bug fixes

**Time and Expense**

The following issues have been fixed:

- An error occurs when you create and save a time entry on the **Quick Create** page if the **Role** field is removed.
- The Time Entry filter applies the wrong filter operator.
- Copied timesheets aren't automatically displayed when you select **Copy Week** on the time entry control.

**Resource Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

- When you extend a booking, the booking status assigned to the hard booking is incorrect. Extending a booking respects the booking status defined as **Committed** in the booking setup metadata.
- When a valid booking status isn't specified, the error message is not correctly localized.

**Project Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Projects can't be created in one currency and include related tasks in another currency.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- When a price list is copied, prices aren't updated.
- Closing a quote as won fails when the cost detail has a value for origin.
- On the **Project Task** entity, **Estimated Cost** has been renamed to **Planned Cost (Base)**.
- A null reference exception is generated when invoices are created or deleted.
