Dynamics 365 Project Service Application is a legacy application that is currently out of support as of March 31st, 2025, in commercial cloud. Microsoft stopped selling any new PSA licenses as of October 31st, 2020, when the formal SKU deprecation was announced. Please see a string of these announcements in 2020: 

- [Introducing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2020/02/20/introducing-microsoft-dynamics-365-project-operations/)

Most of our PSA customers have already upgraded to Dynamics 365 Project Operations or moved other products as their needs aligned.  Dynamics 365 PSA license SKUs are no longer available in our systems, and we cannot backfill your license entitlement to PSA via your Project Operations license. If you are looking for documentation and help for transitioning to Project Operations, learn more in [Upgrade from Project Service Automation to Project Operations](upgrade-project-operations-non-stocked).

### What if you are still able to access Dynamics 365 PSA application

Some legacy licenses may be still able to provide access to Dynamics 365 PSA application. While Microsoft cannot validate how you are accessing Dynamics 365 PSA application, we strongly recommend not to rely on this access and migrate off this application as soon as you can. Microsoft is unable to guarantee continued access to an application that has been retired 5 years ago.  

### For customers of Dynamics 365 Project Service Application on sovereign clouds, GCC, GCC High or DoD

If you are on GCC, GCC High or DoD or other sovereign clouds, you are not impacted by this deprecation and can continue to access Dynamics 365 Project Service Application.
