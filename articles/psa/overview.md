Dynamics 365 Project Service Application is a legacy application that goes out of support on March 31, 2025, in commercial cloud. Microsoft stopped selling new PSA licenses on October 31, 2020, when the formal SKU deprecation occurred. Learn more in the following announcements from 2020:

Most of our PSA customers have already upgraded to Dynamics 365 Project Operations or moved to other products as their needs aligned. Dynamics 365 PSA license SKUs are no longer available in our systems, and we can't backfill your license entitlement to PSA through your Project Operations license. If you're looking for documentation and help for transitioning to Project Operations, learn more in [Upgrade from Project Service Automation to Project Operations](upgrade-project-operations-non-stocked.md).

### What if you can still access Dynamics 365 PSA application

Some legacy licenses might still provide access to Dynamics 365 PSA application. While Microsoft can't validate how you're accessing Dynamics 365 PSA application, we strongly recommend not relying on this access and migrating away from this application as soon as you can. Microsoft can't guarantee continued access to an application that Microsoft retired five years ago.  

### For customers of Dynamics 365 Project Service Application on sovereign clouds, GCC, GCC High, or DoD

If you're on GCC, GCC High, DoD, or other sovereign clouds, this deprecation doesn't affect you. You can continue to access Dynamics 365 Project Service Application.
