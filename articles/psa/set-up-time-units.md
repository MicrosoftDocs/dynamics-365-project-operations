Configure the time units in the product catalog that you’ll use as a base for scheduling and billing your projects.  
  
1. Go to **Settings > Product Catalog**.  
  
2. Click **Unit Groups**.  
  
3. Click the **Time** unit group (created during [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] installation).  
  
4. On the **Units** tab, click **Add New Unit**, and then change the values as necessary. Add as many units as you need. For example, you might want to create the following units:  
  
   - **Day** with **Base unit** = **Hour** and **Quantity** = 8  
  
   - **Week** with **Base unit** = **Day** and **Quantity** = 5
