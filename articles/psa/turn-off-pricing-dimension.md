# Turn off a pricing dimension

[!include [banner](../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]

You may need to review and update your pricing strategy every few years. Any updates you make might require that you turn off an existing pricing dimension and create a new one. For example, you may have previously priced by **Role**, but now you have decided to price by **Work Experience**. This may require you to turn off **Role** as a pricing dimension and create **Work Expereince** as a new pricing dimension. 

Turning off a pricing dimension, regardless if it is out-of-the-box or custom, can be done by setting the **Applicable to Cost** and **Applicable to Sales** fields of the Pricing Dimension to **No**.

However, when you do this, you might receive the following error message.

![Business Process Error likely when turning off a pricing dimension.](media/Business-Process-Error.png)


This error message indicates that there are price records that were previously set up for the dimension that is being turned off. All **Role Price** and **Role Price Markup** records that refer to a dimension must be deleted before the dimension’s applicability can be to set to **No**. This rule applies to both out-of-the-box pricing dimensions and any custom pricing dimensions that you may have created. The reason for this validation is because Project Service has a constraint that each **Role Price** record must have a unique combination of dimensions. For example, on a price list called **US Cost Rates 2018**, you have the following **Role price** rows. 

| Standard Title         | Org Unit    |Unit   |Price  |Currency  |
| -----------------------|-------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Systems Engineer|Contoso US|Hour| 100|USD|
| Senior Systems Engineer|Contoso US|Hour| 150| USD|


When you turn off **Standard Title** as the pricing dimension, and the Project Service pricing engine searches for a price, it will only use the **Org Unit** value from the input context. If the **Org Unit** of the input context is “Contoso US”, the result will be non-deterministic because both the rows will match. To avoid this scenario, when you create **Role Price** records, Project Service validates that the combination of dimensions is unique. If the dimension is turned off after the **Role Price** records are created, this constraint can be violated. Therefore, it is required that before you turn off a dimension, you delete all **Role Price** and **Role Price Markup** rows that have that dimension value populated.
