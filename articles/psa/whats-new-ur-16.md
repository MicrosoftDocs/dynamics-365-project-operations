## Update Release 16

### Bug fixes

-   Time and Expense

    -   Fixed: Users attempting to submit deleted time and expense entries for
        approvals will now receive relevant error messages.

-   Project Management

    -   Fixed: The resourcing units defined for team members in templates are
        respected with the templates are applied to a new project.

    -   Fixed: Improved handling of the re-assignment of record ownership.

    -   Fixed: Projects that are in the process of being copied will not be permitted to
        copied until all copy operations are complete.

-   Resource Management

    -   Fixed: Extend bookings now handles short durations correctly and no longer
        creates zero hours for extended bookings.

    -   Fixed: The reconciliation view now renders when the project time zone is
        +5:30 GMT and the user’s time aone is different.

-   Sales

    -   Fixed: When a project mapped to a contract line is removed and a new project is mapped, the actual records on the new project were not getting re-evaluated based on the billing and pricing rules defined on the contract line. This has been fixed in this release. Pricing and actual records on the newly mapped project will get reversed and re-created correctly based on the pricing and billing rules of the contract line. The actual records of the un-mapped project will also get re-evaluated and re-created as a consequence.

    -   Fixed: Additional validation has been added to an estimate line’s
        **Amount** field to ensure that null values are not persisted.

    -   Fixed: When actuals have been updated on a project, a
        refresh button has been added to the project main form to allow users to
        re-sync the actuals.

    -   Fixed: When users upgrade from 2.X to 3.X, projects with a NULL value
        for project name will be permitted.
