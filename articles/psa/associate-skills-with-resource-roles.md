While you were adding resource roles, you probably already associated some skills to them. From time to time, you might need to add additional skills to a resource role.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resource Roles.**  
  
2.  Click the resource role you want to add skills to.  
  
3.  In the **Skills** area, click **+** to add a skill.  
  
4.  In the Role competency requirement pane, click in the **Skill** field, click the **Search** button,  and then select a skill.  
  
5.  Select a proficiency for that skill, and then click **Save**.  
  
6.  Continue adding skills as necessary. When youâ€™re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
