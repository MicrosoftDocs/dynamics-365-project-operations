# View resource availability (Project Service)

You can check resource availability to get an overall view of how booked your resources are, or you can filter the view by skills, team, location, and other options.

1. Go to **Project Service > Resource Availability**.  

    This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability. Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  

2. Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  

3. Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.
