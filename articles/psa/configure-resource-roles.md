Roles play an important part in project planning, when determining resource requirements or costs of a project. For each role your projects require, you need to create a resource role and associate skills and proficiencies to that role. For example, you might want to create roles for developer, project manager, or game tester. You’ll also set the skills and proficiency levels required for the role.  
  
 Configure resource roles to ensure effective project estimation for your organization.  Also make sure you accurately set the billing type. An item set with a non-chargeable billing type doesn’t show up on contract or quote lines.  
  
 Once you’ve set up resource roles, you can set up cost and sales prices with a price list.  
  
 For each role you want to add, do the following:  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resource Roles**.  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  In the **General** area, enter a name for the role in **Name**, and then fill in the other fields as necessary.  
  
4.  Click **Save** to create the record so you can continue editing it.  
  
5.  In the **Skills** area, click **+** to add a skill.  
  
6.  In the **Role competency requirement** pane, click in the **Skill** field, click the **Search** button, and then select a skill.  
  
7.  Select a proficiency for that skill, and then click **Save**.  
  
8.  Continue adding skills as necessary. When you’re done, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
9. To make this resource role available for projects to use, click **Activate**.
