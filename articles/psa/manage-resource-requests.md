Account managers and project managers regularly request resources for their projects. With the [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities, you can find and match consultants who have the required skills and proficiencies to those resource requests.  
  
1. Go to **Project Service** > **Resource Requests**.  
  
2. Select a resource request and click **Find Resources**. This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability, with color coding that provides a visual view of a resourceâ€™s booking status.  
  
    Do any of the following to optimize your search:  
  
   -   Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  
  
   -   Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  
  
   -   Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.

3. In the calendar for the resource you want to book, select the time period to book the resource, and then either click **Book** to book the resource or **Propose Booking** to propose the booking and have the requestor approve it. When you book a resource, you can soft book or hard book.
