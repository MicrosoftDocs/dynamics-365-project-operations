# Actuals overview

Actuals are the amount of work that has been completed on a project. Project actuals can be traced back to their source documents. Those source documents include time, expense, and journal entries, and also invoices.

![How project actuals are traced to source documents.](media/basic-guide-18.png)

## Submitting a time entry

In PSA, when a time entry is submitted for a project that is mapped to a time-and-materials contract line, two journal lines are created. One line is for cost, and the other line is for unbilled sales. When a time entry is submitted for a project that is mapped to a fixed-price contract line, a journal line is created only for cost. 

Logic for entering default prices resides on the journal line. All the field values from a time entry are copied to the journal line. These fields include the date of the transaction, the contract line that the project is mapped to, and the currency result in the appropriate price list. 

The fields that affect default prices, such as **Role** and **Org Unit**, cause an appropriate price to be entered by default on the journal line. If you add a custom field on the time entry, and you want the field value to be propagated to actuals, create the field on the Actuals entity, and use field mappings to copy the field from the time entry to the actual.

## Submitting an expense entry

In PSA, when an expense entry is submitted for a project that is mapped to a time-and-materials contract line, two journal lines are created. One line is for cost, and the other line is for unbilled sales. When an expense entry is submitted for a project that is mapped to a fixed-price contract line, a journal line is created only for cost.

Logic for entering default prices for expenses is based on the expense category that is selected on the **Expense entry** page. The transaction date, the contract line that the project is mapped to, and the currency are all used to determine the appropriate price list. However, for the price itself, the amount that the user entered is set directly on the related expense journal lines for cost and sales by default.

In the current version of PSA, category-based entry of per-unit default prices on expense entries isn't available.

## Using Entry journals to record costs

In PSA, Entry journals let you record the cost or revenue in the material, fee, time, expense, or tax transaction classes. A journal has a header, lines, and a **Confirm** action. Here are some scenarios where you might use a journal:

- You must record material actual costs and sales on a project.
- You must move transaction actuals from another system to PSA.
- You must record costs that occurred in another system, such as procurement or subcontracting costs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Entry journals to create actuals should be done only by a user who is fully aware of the accounting impact the Actuals have on the project. This is because the application does not validate the journal line type, or the related pricing that is entered on the journal line. Because of the impact of this journal type, exercise adequate caution in who is given access to create Entry journals.     


## Recording actuals based on project events

PSA records the financial transactions that occur during a project. These transactions are recorded as **actuals**. The following tables show the different types of actuals that are created, depending on whether the project is a time-and-materials or fixed-price project, is in the presales stage, or is an internal project.

**The resource belongs to same organizational unit as the project's contracting unit**
