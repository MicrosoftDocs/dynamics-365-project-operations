**Time and Expense**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Users can't see working hours logged on non-working days in the time entry grid.
- Approved expense entries can be edited on the grid.

**Project Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Missing validation logic to ensure resource assignment effort hours can't be negative.
- The custom action, **AssignResourcesForTask** updates all fields instead of only changed fields.
- When copying a project in an environment with plug-ins or workflows that are registered on the **CreateProject** event, the **msdyn_bulkgenerationstatus** attribute isn't updated if the **CopyWBSToProject** fails.
- When you expand the project calendar, the working days aren't sorted in ascending order causing some project task updates to fail.
- Changing the Project Manager on an existing project triggers the organizational unit defaulting logic.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- The **Contract Performance** tab on the **Contract** page fails silently during initialization when no contract lines are present.
