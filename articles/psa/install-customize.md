[!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] capabilities are an end-to-end solution that you need to install before users can start using the capabilities to manage and deliver project-based sales. While it's an end-to-end solution, you can still make customizations as needed to suit your organization.  
<!-- TODO: I expect to find the information on how to get and install this here. Please find that and add it here. Same for Project Service.-->
