Add resources so you can book them for projects. Resources can include users, contacts, accounts, groups, or equipment—anything that you might want to include in your project scheduling and invoicing.  
  
You can assign resources to organizational units if you need to have different costing and pricing for resources for different divisions in your company.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Resources.**  
  
2.  Click **New**.  
  
3.  Select the **Resource Type**, and then select the settings you want for each field.  
  
4.  Click **Save** to save the record so you can continue editing it.  
  
5.  To add a skill for the resource, click **+** under **Resource Skills**.  
  
6.  In the screen that pops up, fill in the fields as needed and click the **Save** button at the bottom right corner of the screen.  
  
7.  Continue adding skills as necessary.  
  
8.  To add a resource role, click **+** under **Resource Role**.  
  
9. When you’re done making changes, click **Save** at the bottom right corner of the screen.
