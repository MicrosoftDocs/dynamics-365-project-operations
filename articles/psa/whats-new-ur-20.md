**Project Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Users receive an incorrect error when the maximum number of characters have been entered into the **Description** field for a project task.
- The **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation add-in download** page redirects to the English download page when the user’s language settings are set to Japanese.
- When a server error occurs, the synchronization label on the **Schedule** tab of the **Projects** form sometimes remains.
- Redundant task updates are being sent to the server when a task is modified.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- On the **Contract** form, double-clicking **Create Invoice** creates two invoices for a single actuals record.
- In Internet Explorer 11, users are unable to create expense entries.
- Reversal of Cost and reversal of Unbilled Sales Actuals are not linked.
- The **Refresh Actuals** button on the **Project** form does not refresh **Task Actual Hours**.
- The **PreValidateProjectTeamMemberCreate** plug-in can create duplicate generic bookable resources when the attribute **msdyn_isgenericresourceprojectscoped** is set to **False**.
- **Recalculate** clears chargeable costs of product-based quote line details and contract line details.
- In specific scenarios, the **PostEstimateLineUpdate** plug-in displays a null teference exception error.
- Time phase duration on the **Profitability Analysis Chart** does not match duration of the costs in the fixed-price quote line detail of the quote.

- **Org Unit Cost Price** lists permit overlaps in the date effectivity.
- Users are not permitted to change the **OrgUnit** when the order type is not work-based because it will lead to a null reference exception error.
- When attempting to navigate from the **Quote Line Details** form, back to the **Quote** tab, the form refreshes and displays the **Summary** tab.
