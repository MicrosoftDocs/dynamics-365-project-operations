## Update Release 27

### Bug fixes

**General**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Logs generated by plug-ins in Project Service Automation haven't been set to auto-delete.
- Auto-upgrade fails because the Project Service Automation solution contains a legacy null NavBarArea and title element.

**Time and Expense**

The following issues have been fixed:

- The **Time Entry** grid displays incorrect data for **TimeZone Independent** date behavior.
- The **Time Entry** grid creates incorrect time for **TimeZone Independent** date behavior.
- Task lookup isn't limited to the selected project on the **Edit Time Entry** page.
- Time approval for non-project time entries is blocked because the system is looking for a project approver.
- Correct entries on Actuals displays an incorrect error message.
- When a task contains a null value for actual cost and the project totals are refreshed, the following error occurs, "Given key not present in dictionary".
- In specific instances, **Group By** filters on the **Project Estimate** tab does not display expense estimates.
- **Daylight Saving Time** interval isn't correct for time entries.

**Project Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Caching improvements, which enhances performance related to loading the **Project** page.
- Obsolete business rule preventing project tasks from being completed.
- Microsoft Project Add-in contours aren't respecting the add-in’s calendar resulting in incorrect resource requirements.
- Creating projects from templates incorrectly sets assignment dates and prevents the ability to generate resource requirements.
- User can't access **Category**, **Description**, **Status** options using the keyboard.
- Actual sales values of the project aren't including fee and materials sales values.
- Aggregation of actual sales and actual cost happens incorrectly with different exchange rates.
- The description in the **Default Work Hour Template** is misleading.
- Indenting a task doesn't remove **Category** in the user interface until it is refreshed.
- Missing validation to ensure moving a project beyond its end date isn't permitted.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- A null reference exception is generated on a project quote line because **Import from Project Estimation** is visible when a project hasn't been selected.
- The following error, "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" occurs when closing a quote as **Won**.
- Adjustment status isn't set during an actual reversal while unlinking a project from a contract line.
- When Dynamics 365 Field Service and Project Service Automation are both installed, the **Lock pricing** and **Use Current Pricing** options are not displayed at a same time on the **Invoice** page.
- For the Japanese language, there is inconsistent translation with other calendar-based pages.
- **Activate** and **Deactivate** have been removed from **Price List Association** entities in Project Service Automation.
