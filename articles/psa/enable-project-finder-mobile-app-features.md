# Enable Project Finder Mobile app features (Project Service)

[!include [banner](../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x](../includes/cc-applies-to-psa-app-1x-2x.md)]

Your resources can use the Project Finder Mobile app on their phone with [!INCLUDE[pn_project_service_auto](../includes/pn-project-service-auto.md)] to find new projects to work on and update their skillsets.  
  
 The app is available for [!INCLUDE[tn_Apple_iphone](../includes/tn-apple-iphone.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_android](../includes/tn-android.md)] phones, and [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_phone](../includes/pn-windows-phone.md)].  
    
 To allow users to view project resource requirements and update skills, options must be selected in the parameter settings for your organizational unit.
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Project Finder Mobile app only works with [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], not with on-premises installations.  
  
1. Go to **Project Service > Parameters**.  
  
2. Click the parameters setting you want to use for allowing the Project Finder Mobile app features.  
  
3. In the **General** area, set **Resource requirements visible to resources** to **Yes**.  
  
4. Set **Allow skill update by resource** to **Yes**.  
  
   ![ProjectService&#95;ProjectFinderEnable.](../psa/media/project-service-project-finder-enable.png "ProjectService_ProjectFinderEnable")  
  
   This is a global setting. Project managers can set whether an individual project will be visible on that project's **Project Team** page.
