Now that you’ve added the skills for your clients’ projects, you need a way to rate your consultants’ skills so you can match them to project requirements. You can use the default proficiency model, edit it, or create a new one to match the needs of your organization.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Proficiency Models**.  
  
2.  To view or edit the default proficiency model, click **Default Rating Model** in the list, or to create a new proficiency model, click **New**.  
  
3.  If you’re creating a new proficiency model, fill in the fields in the **General** area, and then click **Save** to create the record so you can continue editing it. When you create your own proficiency model, keep in mind that higher numbers are better.  
  
     For example, if you’re viewing or editing the default rating model, you’ll see the following proficiency levels in **Rating Values**.  
  
    |Name|Value|  
    |----------|-----------|  
    |Familiar|1|  
    |Good|2|  
    |Proficient|3|  
  
4.  To add or change a proficiency level, click the table button and make the changes you want.  
  
5.  Click the **Save** button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
