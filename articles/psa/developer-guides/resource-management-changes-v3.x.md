# Resource management changes (Project Service Automation 3.x)

[!include [banner](../../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]

The sections of this article provide information about the changes that have been made to the Resource management area of Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation version 3.x.

## Project estimates

Instead of being based on the **msdyn\_projecttask** entity (**Project Task**), project estimates are based on the **msdyn\_resourceassignment** entity (**Resource Assignment**). Resource assignments have become the "source of truth" for task scheduling and pricing.

## Line tasks

In PSA 3.x, line tasks are obsolete (deprecated). Assignments now point to the whole task instead of the line tasks.

The following example shows how a task that is named "Test task" is assigned to team members A and B in earlier versions of PSA and in PSA 3.x.

- **Before PSA 3.x:**

    - Test task

        - Test task – Line task 1

            - Assignment to A

        - Test task – Line task 2

            - Assignment to B

- **PSA 3.x:**

    - Test task

        - Assignment to A
        - Assignment to B

## Unassigned assignment

In PSA 3.x, an unassigned assignment is an assignment that is assigned to a **NULL** team member and a **NULL** resource. Unassigned assignments can occur in a couple of scenarios:

- If a task has been created, but it hasn't yet been assigned to any team member, an unassigned assignment is always created. 
- If all assignees on a task are removed, an unassigned assignment is re-created for that task.

## Scheduling fields on the Project Task entity

The fields on the **msdyn\_projecttask** entity have been deprecated or moved to the **msdyn\_resourceassignment** entity, or they are now referenced from the **msdyn\_projectteam** entity (**Project Team Member**).

| Deprecated field on msdyn\_projecttask (Project Task) | New field on msdyn\_resourceassignment (Resource Assignment) | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| msdyn\_assignedresources | None | |
| msdyn\_assignedteammembers | None | |
| msdyn\_numberofresources | None | |
| msdyn\_scheduledhours | None | |
| msdyn\_effortcontour | msdyn\_plannedwork | The format of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that is stored in the field has been changed. |

## Schedule contour

The schedule contour is stored in the **Planned Work** field (**msdyn\_plannedwork**) of each **Resource Assignment** entity (**msdyn\_resourceassignment**).

### Structure

The new structure of the schedule contour consists of flexible time slices that are defined for each day of the schedule. Each time slice has the following properties:

- **Start** – The start of the working hours for the day, according to the project calendar.
- **End** – The end of the working hours for the day, according to the project calendar.
- **Hours** – The number of hours that are assigned on the day.

**Example**

This example uses a project calendar where the workday is from 9 AM to 5 PM in the UTC-8 time zone.

```json
[{"End":"\/Date(1543885200000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543856400000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1543971600000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543942800000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1544058000000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1544029200000)\/","Hours":2}]
```

### Auto-scheduling and manual scheduling

If a task is auto-scheduled, the hours are front-loaded, and the task duration might be reduced.

**Example**

The following task is auto-scheduled for 18 hours over three days (December 3, 2018, to December 5, 2018).

```json
[{"End":"\/Date(1543885200000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543856400000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1543971600000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543942800000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1544058000000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1544029200000)\/","Hours":2}]
```

If a task is manually scheduled, the hours are evenly distributed to all the dates.

**Example**

The following task is manually scheduled for 18 hours over three days (December 3, 2018, to December 5, 2018).

```json
[{"End":"\/Date(1543885200000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543856400000)\/","Hours":6},{"End":"\/Date(1543971600000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543942800000)\/","Hours":6},{"End":"\/Date(1544058000000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1544029200000)\/","Hours":6}]
```

### Assignment unit

The assignment unit has been deprecated in PSA 3.x. The task effort hours are now equally divided, per day, among all the assigned resources.

**Example**

In this example, the task is is assigned to two resources and is auto-scheduled for 36 hours over three days (December 3, 2018, to December 5, 2018).

- Assignment 1:

    ```json
    [{"End":"\/Date(1543885200000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543856400000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1543971600000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543942800000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1544058000000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1544029200000)\/","Hours":2}]
    ```

- Assignment 2:

    ```json
    [{"End":"\/Date(1543885200000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543856400000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1543971600000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1543942800000)\/","Hours":8},{"End":"\/Date(1544058000000)\/","Start":"\/Date(1544029200000)\/","Hours":2}]
    ```

## Pricing dimensions

In PSA 3.x, resource-specific pricing dimension fields (such as **Role** and **Organizational Unit**) have been removed from the **msdyn\_projecttask** entity. These fields can now be retrieved from the corresponding project team member (**msdyn\_projectteam**) of the resource assignment (**msdyn\_resourceassignment**) when project estimates are generated. A new field, **msdyn\_organizationalunit**, has been added to the **msdyn\_projectteam** entity.

| Deprecated field on msdyn\_projecttask (Project Task) | Field from msdyn\_projectteam (Project Team Member) that is used instead |
|---|---|
| msdyn\_resourcecategory | msdyn\_resourcecategory |
| msdyn\_organizationalunit | msdyn\_organizationalunit |

## Contours

The pricing and estimation contour fields have been deprecated on the **msdyn\_projecttask** entity. They have been moved to the **msdyn\_resourceassignment** entity.

| Deprecated field on msdyn\_projecttask (Project Task) | New field on msdyn\_resourceassignment (Resource Assignment) |
|---|---|
| msdyn\_costestimatecontour | msdyn\_plannedcostcontour |
| msdyn\_salesestimatecontour | msdyn\_plannedsalescontour |

The following fields have been added to the **msdyn\_resourceassignment** entity:

* msdyn\_plannedcost
* msdyn\_plannedsales

The following fields for planned, actual, and remaining cost and sales are unchanged on the **msdyn\_projecttask** entity:

* msdyn\_plannedcost
* msdyn\_plannedsales
* msdyn\_actualcost
* msdyn\_actualsales
* msdyn\_remainingcost
* msdyn\_remainingsales
