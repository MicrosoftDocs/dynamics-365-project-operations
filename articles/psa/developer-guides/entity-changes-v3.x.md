# Entity, control, and user interface changes (Project Service Automation 3.x)

[!include [banner](../../includes/psa-now-project-operations.md)]


With the release of Microsoft Dynamics Project Service Automation (PSA) 3.x, many changes have been made to the entities, controls, views, and user interface. This article provides information about these important changes.

## Parent-child relationships for sales document, sales document line, sales document line detail entities
In versions of Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation (PSA) released prior to version 3.0, some of the relationships between sales documents, sales document lines, and sales document line detail entities were implemented through string fields that would hold a string representation of GUID of the related entity. This was due to platform limitations that required significant custom code on the server and client sides of the solution to make those relationships work similar to typical Dynamics CRM entity relationships and to make string fields act like lookup fields.

PSA 3.0 has been updated to leverage the new entity relationships between sales document and sales document line entities.

Because lookup fields can now be used to indicate references to entities, the fields that held the string value of the GUID of the related entity in previous versions are no longer needed and therefore have been deprecated. The custom client and server side code that handles the relationships defined by legacy string fields has also been deprecated.

### Entity schema changes
The following table provides a one-to-one list of the deprecated string fields and the new lookup fields for the entities.

## Unified Client Interface App Module
With the introduction of Unified Client Interface (UCI) App Modules, the PSA site map entries have been removed from the system.  
Functionality related to form switching for Opportunity, Quote, Order, Invoice has been deprecated as it is no longer required because the UCI App Module includes only PSA versions of the forms.  

The following web resources have been deprecated:

- msdyn_\SalesDocument\SalesDocumentFormLoader.js
- msdyn_\SalesDocument\PSSalesDocumentCustomFormIds.js
