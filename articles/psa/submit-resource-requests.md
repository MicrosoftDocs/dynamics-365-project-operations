Once you’ve won a project contract, you’ll need to staff your project. Your work breakdown structure already established the resource roles you need to complete the project, so now it’s time to request the resources that match the requirements.  
  
1.  Go to **Project Service > Projects**.  
  
2.  Click the project you want to work on.  
  
3.  In the bar across the top of the screen, select the down arrow next to the project name, and then click **Resource Requirements**.  
  
4.  To submit resource requests, select the roles you want to request resources for, and then click **Submit Request**.  
  
5.  To hard book a resource instead, select the role, and then click **Hard Book**. This shows a calendar view of all resources and their availability, with color coding that provides a visual view of a resource’s booking status. Do any of the following to optimize your search:  
  
    -   Select a view or sort order from the top of the screen. You can also select whether to show availability for the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**, and use the arrows to view the previous or next time period. Use the search box to find a specific resource.  
  
    -   Click **Options** to change what displays. For example, you can show a legend that shows the color scheme for the different types of bookings, or you can choose to show only a certain type of booking (for example, hard booking or soft booking).  
  
    -   Click **Filter** to display the **Filter** pane, which lets you filter your results by organizational unit, role, skill, or other attributes.  
  
    -   In the calendar for the resource you want to book, select the time period to book the resource, and either click **Book** to book the resource, or **Propose Booking** to propose the booking and have the requestor approve it.  
  
6.  A resource manager needs to review and approve your resource requests.
