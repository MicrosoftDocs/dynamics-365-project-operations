# Products

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Products are the backbone of your business. The product catalog in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional is a collection of products and pricing information. Make it easier for your sales reps to increase their sales by creating a product catalog quickly.

## Add a product

1.  Make sure you have the Sales Manager Professional or a System Administrator role so you can add products in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional.
2.  In the site map, under **Setup**, select **Products**.
3.  Select **Add Product** and fill in the following information:

    -  **Name**
    -  **Product ID**
    -  **Parent**: Select a parent product family for the product. If you're creating a child product in a product family, the name of the parent product family is populated here. This can't be changed after the record is saved.
    -  **Valid From**/**Valid To**: Define the period the product is valid for by selecting a **Valid From** and **Valid To** date.
    -  **Unit Group**: Select a unit group. A unit group is a collection of various units a product is sold in and defines how individual items are grouped into larger quantities. For example, if you're adding seeds as a product, you might have created a unit group called "Seeds" and defined its primary unit as "packet."
    -  **Default Unit**: Select the most common unit in which the product will be sold. Units are the quantities or measurements that you sell your products in. For example, if you're adding seeds as a product, you can sell it in packets, boxes, or pallets. Each of these becomes a unit of the product. If seeds are mostly sold in packets, select that as the unit.
    -  **Default Price List**: If this is a new product, this field is read-only. Before you can select a default price list, you must complete all the required fields and then save the record. Although the default price list is not required, after you save the product record, it is a good idea to set a default price list for each product. Then, if a customer record does not contain a price list, Sales can use the default price list for generating quotes, orders, and invoices.
    -  **Decimals Supported**: Enter a whole number between 0 and 5. If the product can't be divided into fractional quantities, enter 0. The precision of the **Quantity** field in the quote, order, or invoice product record is validated against the value in this field if the product does not have an associated price list.
    -  **Subject**: Associate this product with a subject. You can use subjects to categorize your products and to filter reports.

4.  Select **Save**.
5.  On the **Additional Details** tab, in the **Price List Items** section, select **More commands**, and then select **Add New Price List Item**.
7.  On the **Additional Details** tab, in the **Product Relationship** section, select the **More commands** icon, and then select **Add New Product Relationship.**
8.  In the **New Product Relationship** form, enter the following details, and on the command bar, select **Save and Close**:

    -   **Related Product**: Select a product that you want to add as a related product to the existing product record you're working on.
    -   **Sales Relation Type**: Select whether you want to add the product as an up-sell, cross-sell, accessory, or substitute product.
    -   **Direction**:Select whether the relationship between the products will be unidirectional or bidirectional. When you select unidirectional, the product that you select in **Related Product** will be shown as a recommendation for the existing product but not vice versa.

9.  On the Product form, select **Save**.

## Import products

You can use import templates to bring bulk product data into Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Revise a product

Keep the product inventory updated by quickly revising properties for the products, as required, and republishing the information so that your sales agents can see the latest changes to the inventory.

1.  Make sure that you have one of the following security roles or equivalent permissions: System Administrator, System Customizer, Sales Manager, Vice President of Sales, Vice President of Marketing, or CEO-Business Manager.
2.  In the site map, select **Products**.
3.  Open an active product that you want to change, and on the command bar, select **Revise**.
4.  In the **Confirm Revise** dialog box, select **Confirm**. This will change the product status to **Under Revision**.
5.  After you're done making changes, on the command bar, select **Publish**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To revert the changes and continue with the last active version of the product, select **Revert**. This changes the status of the product back to **Active**.

## Clone a product 

When you're creating a new product, save time by cloning an existing one. This creates a copy of the original record with all the details except for the name and ID.

1.  Make sure that you have one of the following security roles or equivalent permissions: System Administrator, System Customizer, Sales Manager, Vice President of Sales, Vice President of Marketing, or CEO-Business Manager.
2.  In the site map, select **Products**.
3.  Select a product record that you want to clone, and on the command bar, select **Clone**. A confirmation dialog box appears.
4.  Select **Confirm**.

A new product record opens with the same details as the original one except for the name and ID.

## Retire a product 

If your organization doesn't sell a product anymore, retire it so that the product is no longer available to your sales agents.

1.  Make sure that you have the System Administrator or Sales Professional Manager role or equivalent permissions.
2.  In the site map, select **Products**.
3.  Open an active product that you want to retire, and on the command bar, select **Retire**.
4.  In the **Confirm Retire** dialog box, select **Confirm**.


## Delete a product

To stop selling a product, delete it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't recover a deleted record.

1.  Make sure that you have the System Administrator or Sales Professional Manager role or equivalent permissions.
2.  In the site map, select **Products**.
3.  Select a product record you want to delete, and on the command bar, select **Delete**.
4.  In the **Confirm Deletion** dialog box, select **Continue**.
 
 ## Quantity factors for products

Quantity factors support the sale of subscription-based products. For subscription-based products, the quantity on the quote or project contract line is expressed as the number of user months.

Usually, the price of subscription software is stored in the catalog as the price per user per month. However, you can use other time descriptions instead. During the sales process, the price on the quote line is usually the per-user, per-month price that was negotiated and discounted by the IT sales agent. Each deal has a different number of users and a different number of subscription months. The quantity that is used to compute the amount of the quote line is a product of the number of users and the number of subscription months.

Quantity factors rely on product attributes. When you configure specific properties for a product, you can flag a subset of those properties, or all the properties, as quantity factors.

The system validates that only numeric properties or product properties that have a numeric data type are flagged as quantity factors. When a product that quantity factors are configured for is added to a quote line, the **Quantity** field on the quote line becomes a read-only field. After you enter values for product properties that are quantity factors, the quantity of the quote line is calculated.

For example, if there are the following properties: 

- **No of users**: The number of users 
- **No of Months**: The number of subscription months
- **Product SKU** 

The **No of Users** and **No of Months** properties can be flagged as quantity factors by editing the properties of the product line.
