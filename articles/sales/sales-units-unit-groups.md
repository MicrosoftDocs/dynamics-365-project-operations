# Units and unit groups

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

Units are the quantities or measurements that you use to sell your products or services. For example, if you sell gardening supplies, you might sell seeds in units of packets, boxes, and pallets. A unit group is a collection of these different units.

To complete the steps in this article, make sure that you're assigned to the System Administrator, or Sales Professional Manager role or have equivalent permissions.

## Create a unit group

1. In the site map, select **Units**.
1. Select **New**, and in the **Create Unit Group** dialog box, enter the unit name.
1. In the **Primary unit** field, enter the lowest common unit of measure that the product is sold in. For example, you might enter "piece" or "ounce".
1. Select **OK**.

## Add units to a unit group

1. Open a unit group, and on the **Related** tab, select **Units**. You see that the primary unit is already added.
1. Select **Add New Unit**, and on the **Quick Create: Unit** page, in the **Name** field, enter the name of the unit.
1. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity that the unit contains. For example, if a box contains two pieces, enter "2". 
1. In the **Base unit** field, select a base unit to establish the lowest unit of measurement for the unit. For example, you might select "Piece".
1. Select **Save**.
