# Use a bookable resource as a pricing dimension

 _**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_ 

This article provides information about how to use a bookable resource as a pricing dimension. If your pricing strategy is set up so that each bookable resource must have a specific price or cost rate, use a bookable resource as a pricing dimension.

## Prerequisites
Before you complete the procedures in this article, you must have a new pricing dimension solution for your organization. If you haven't already created one, see [Create custom fields and entities](../pricing-costing/create-custom-fields-entities-pricing-dimensions.md).

## Add the Bookable Resource field to forms and views
To make the **Bookable Resource** field visible in the pricing dimension solution, you need to add the field to all the forms and views as an entity.

The following table lists all of the out-of-the box forms and views, by entity. You will also need to add the new field to any additional forms or views in your customized entities.

## Set up a bookable resource as a pricing dimension
To set up a bookable resource as a pricing dimension, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Parameters**. 
2. On the **Parameter** page, on the **Amount-Based Pricing Dimensions** tab, verify that the grid shows the records in the **Pricing Dimensions** entity. 
2. Add **Bookable Resource** to this list of pricing dimensions as **msdyn_bookableresource**. 
3. In **Applicable to cost** and **Applicable to sales**, select a value.
4. In **Dimension Type**, select **Amount-based**. 
5. Select the cost and sales priority for the bookable resource. Typically, a bookable resource has the highest priority when included as a pricing dimension. Set the priority to **1** (or **0** depending on how you count the priority) to ensure this behavior.

## Set up pricing dimension field names

When the field name of a pricing dimension in the **Role Price** table is different from the field name in any of the other entities where the default price is used, the pricing dimension record must be notified of the different names.  

For a bookable resource, the **Project Team Members** entity has a slightly different field name from what it is called on the **Role Price** entity: 

 - **Project Team Members** entity = **msdyn_bookableresourceid**
 - **Role Price** entity = **msdyn_bookableresource**

The pricing dimension record for **msydn_bookableresource** must be notified of this difference.

1. Double-click the row in the **Pricing Dimensions** grid to open the dimension page of **msdyn_bookableresource**.
2. On dimension page, on the **Related** tab, select **Pricing Dimension Field Names**.

5. Add  **msdyn_bookableresourceid** to **Field Name**.
