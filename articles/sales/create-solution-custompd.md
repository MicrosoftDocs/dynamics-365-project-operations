# Create a solution for custom pricing dimensions

 _**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_ 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All custom pricing dimension changes should be in a separate solution. This important best practice allows the flexibility to update or remove changes as needed, helps with re-use of your work, and makes it easier to port changes to other instances. After you make the required changes, export this solution as a **Managed** solution, and then import into other instances for reuse.

## Create a solution for custom pricing dimensions

1.	Select **Settings** > **Solutions**, and then select **New**.
2.	Name the solution, *\<your organization name\> pricing dimensions*.
3. Enter the remaining required information, and then select **Save**.
