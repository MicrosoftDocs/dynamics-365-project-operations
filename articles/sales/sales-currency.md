# Currency

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_



Currencies determine the prices for products in the product catalog and the cost of transactions, such as sales orders. If your customers are spread across geographies, add their currencies to manage your transactions. Add the currencies that are most appropriate for your current and future business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your environment is a Common Data Service environment, you are in the Power Platform admin center, and you select the **Currencies** page (**Environments** > [select environment] > **Settings** > **Business** > **Currencies**), the page will be blank. This is because setting a currency is not supported in Common Data Service environments.

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 
2. Select **Settings** > **Business**.
3. Select **Currencies**.

   |    **Currency Name**    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         If you selected a currency code from the list of available currencies in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, the currency name for the selected code is displayed here. If you selected **Custom** as the currency type, type the name of the currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

   | **Currency Conversion** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Type the value of the selected currency in terms of one US dollar. This is the amount at which the selected currency converts to the base currency. **Important:**  Make sure you update this value as frequently as required to avoid any inaccurate calculations in your transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |


6. When you're done, on the command bar, select **Save** or **Save and Close**.  

   > [!TIP]
   >  To edit a currency, select the currency, and then enter or select the new values.  

## Delete a currency  

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 
2. Select **Settings** > **Business**.
3. Select **Currencies**.  
4. From the list of currencies displayed, select the currency to delete.  
5. Select **Delete**.  
6. Confirm the deletion.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You can't delete currencies that are in use by other records; you can only deactivate them. Deactivating currency records doesn't remove the currency information stored in existing records, such as opportunities or orders. However, you won't be able to select the deactivated currency for new transactions.
