# Close a project opportunity 

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Core deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Project opportunities can be closed as Won or Lost. The **Close opportunity** dialog box allows you put in the status reason, date, and other details about win or loss of the opportunity.

You won't be allowed to close the opportunity if there are any active quotes associated with it. You can close all active and draft quotes associated to an opportunity at the same time. Then you'll be allowed to close the opportunity.

For more general information on closing opportunities, see [Close opportunities as won or lost](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/close-opportunity-won-lost-sales).
