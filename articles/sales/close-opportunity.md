# Close a project opportunity 

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

You can close project opportunities as **Won** or **Lost**. The **Close opportunity** dialog box collects the status reason, date, and other details about the win or loss of the opportunity.

You can't close the opportunity if any active quotes are associated with it. You can close all active and draft quotes associated with an opportunity at the same time. After you close the quotes, you can close the opportunity.

For more information about closing opportunities, see [Close opportunities as won or lost](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/close-opportunity-won-lost-sales).
