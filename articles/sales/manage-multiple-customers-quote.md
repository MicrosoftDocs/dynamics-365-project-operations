# Manage multiple customers on a project-based quote

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP_

Project-based quotes support the scenario where the proposal involves multiple customers who will fund the deal. The **Summary** tab of the Quote has the **Potential customer** field, which identifies the primary customer of the deal. Other customers for the deal can be set up on the **Customers** tab of the project quote.

All quote customers on the **Customers** tab of the project quote default as quote line customers on any **new** project-based quote lines created for the quote. Any existing project-based quote lines will not inherit new quote customer records created after them.

Quote customers and quote line customers can be added, updated, or deleted at any time before the quote is won. A valid customer on the quote must be set up as a customer in the Owning company or Legal entity on the **Customers** page. Legal entities are set up in the **Project management and accounting** module of Dynamics 365 Project Operations and are made available as Companies in the **Project sales and delivery** modules of Project Operations.

## Concept of a primary customer

The customer listed on the **Summary** tab of the project quote as the potential customer is the primary customer of the quote. If you try to delete the primary customer from customers list on the quote, you will receive an error that a primary customer record on a quote can't be deleted.

The primary customer shouldn't be updated from the customer list on the quote. However, you can influence the primary customer by changing the potential customer on the **Summary** tab of the quote. When this field is updated on the **Quote Summary**, the newly selected potential customer is added as a new quote customer with the **Primary** flag set. The old potential customer will still be a customer on the quote.

## Create, Update, or Delete a quote customer record

A quote customer can be created, updated, or deleted from the **Quote customers** tab on the **Quote** page. The fields listed in the following table are on the quote customer record of a project quote.

The list of customers to add in the **Account** field is already filtered to the list from this owning company in the **Project management and accounting** module of Project Operations. | The Owning company equates to the concept of Legal entity in the **Project management and accounting** module of Project Operations.

## Editing billing split percentages

You can edit the billing split percentages by using the in-line grid edit experience. When the billing split percentages don't total 100%, an error will occur. After you update the billing split percentages, refresh the page to remove the error.

You can also try selecting **Evenly Distribute** on the quote customers' subgrid. This action allocates billing splits to all quote customers. If there is any rounding factor, that will be added to the rounding customer. One of the quote customers is always tagged as the rounding customer. this means that the quote customer record has the **Rounding** flag set to **Yes**. Typically this is the primary customer of the quote, but that can be changed.
