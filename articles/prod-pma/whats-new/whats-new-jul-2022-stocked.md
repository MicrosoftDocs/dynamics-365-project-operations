## Features turned on by default in upcoming release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.29. Most features that have been automatically turned on can be turned off in [Feature management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview). In the future, some features that have been automatically turned on might be removed from Feature management and become mandatory.
