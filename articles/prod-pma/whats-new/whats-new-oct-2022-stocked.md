# What's new or changed in Project Operations, October 2022 for stocked/production-based scenarios

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for stocked/production-based scenarios_

This article applies to the following components and versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations:

- Project management and accounting in a Dynamics 365 Finance environment version 10.0.30

## Quality updates

For information about the bug fixes that are included in this update, sign in to Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, and view the [KB article](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?bugId=745468).

## Features turned on by default in upcoming release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.30. Most features that have been automatically turned on can be turned off in [Feature management](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview). In the future, some features that have been automatically turned on might be removed from Feature management and become mandatory. This change ensures that customers are using current functionality, so that enhancements can build on the current functionality as they are added. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they are determined to be essential.
