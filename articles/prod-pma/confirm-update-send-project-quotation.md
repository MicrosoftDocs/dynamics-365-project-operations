# Confirm, update, and send a project quotation

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

After you create and send a project quotation to a customer, you must get confirmation from the customer before you update the quotation status to **Sent**. Any modifications requested by the customer can be updated in the quotation. After you update the quotation status to **Sent**, you can’t modify it. The following procedure describes the options to send a quotation for confirmation, make updates based on feedback, and then send the quotation.

## Send a project quotation confirmation  

You can send an existing project quotation for confirmation through email or as a printed copy. 

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Quotations** > **Project quotation.** 
2. On the **Project quotation** page, select the quotation you want to send for confirmation. 
3. On the **Follow up** tab, in the **Generate** group, select **Confirm**. 
4. On the **Confirm quotation** page, set the required parameters. For example, to print the confirmation, under **Print** options, turn on **Print confirmation**, and then select **OK**.
5. On the **Send quotation** page, select **Options**, and on the **Print destination settings** page, select whether you want the quotation sent to **Screen**, **E-mail**, **File**, **Print archive**, or **Printer**, and then make any adjustments that you want in the **Specification** area to route the quotation.
6. On the **Print destination settings** page, select **OK**.
