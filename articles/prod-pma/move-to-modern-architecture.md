# Move to the modern architecture

As of version 10.0.43, if you use the **Project management and accounting** (PMA) module to manage your projects, you can use the modern architecture of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations to take advantage of the new functionality and modern technology stack.

Many customers who previously used the project capabilities of the **Project management and accounting** module in the finance and operations architecture couldn't turn on the capabilities of the modern architecture of Project Operations in the same legal entity. This option is now available.

In the 10.0.43 release, the **Use the modern architecture for existing legal entities with project data** feature lets you complete all existing transactions and close existing projects in the **Project management and accounting** module. Functionality is further enhanced in the 10.0.45 release where existing projects can be completed and new projects are created in Dataverse. Newer releases have a subset of transactions and processes available to allow users to continue to create and post transactions, perform invoicing, and perform revenue recognition against existing projects until they are completed and closed. You can create new projects, project-based quotes, and contracts by using richer, modern experiences that bring together the project management capabilities of Dataverse and finance and operations apps into one orchestrated, seamless experience. Data from Dataverse is automatically integrated into the same legal entity in finance and operations apps. Likewise, data from finance and operations apps is automatically integrated into Dataverse.

By adopting the modern architecture, you can take advantage of the following features without losing the benefit of the rich project accounting and invoicing capabilities of finance and operations apps:

- Project contract structure
- Sales process
- Project planning functionality that uses Microsoft Project for the web
- Resource management that uses Unified resource management
- Transaction models
- Subcontracting
- Proforma invoice processes

## Enable the modern architecture of Project Operations (10.0.45 and later)

Here's a summary of functionality available. These changes are all additive in support of adding new scenarios and functionality for PMA projects in the context of an integrated legal entity. No changes are made if the legal entity isn't opted in as an integrated company. If you don't see a document or a process is available in this list, then it isn't available in the user interface and isn't enabled. Any documents or processes not available should be in a state where they're complete and assumed to be not available before enabling the feature in production.

**Detailed changes by area:**

| Functionality                  | Details                                             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Projects                     | The Project list page shows both integrated and PMA projects together in a single list. Behavior differs on what items in the ribbon show based on the type of project. PMA projects can be opened to see the details page, but they don't allow for editing of details. |
| Project contracts            | The Project contracts list page shows both integrated and PMA contracts together in a single list. Behavior differs on what items in the ribbon show based on the type of project. PMA project contracts can be opened to see the details page, but they don't allow for editing of details. |
| Pricing setup                | Cost and sales pricing for hours, expenses, or fees can be configured from the ribbon when in the context of a project or contract. Transfer prices are also enabled in the ribbon, but is read-only. |
| Project resources            | The resources list page isn't enabled. New resources can be configured using the human resources to [bookable resource integration](/dynamics365/human-resources/hr-admin-integration-hr-rm). New resources for PMA or modern projects can be created linking the employee record to the bookable resource in Dataverse. Before new resources are available in PMA, a transaction must be posted through to the integration journal for the new bookable resource to an integrated project. This transaction can be a zero cost journal, but some kind of transaction is required to trigger the resource creation. |
| Project parameters           | Project parameters are no longer reset on opting-in a legal entity. All PMA parameters are enabled and editable, but all parameters might not be compatible with integrated projects. When all PMA projects are closed then the parameters specific to PMA projects are hidden in the UI since they're no longer applicable. |
| Project Stage Rules          | Project stage rules are available in the project list and details pages. PMA Projects can change project stages and move to closed when completed. |
| F&O Expense Reports          | Expense reports functionality is available for both PMA and integrated projects. |
| F&O Journals (Hour, Expense, Item, Fee)     | Journals are available in the list or details page for PMA projects in the ribbon.  Journal setup doesn't have a menu, but is available for a read-only view through the journal name hyperlink. |
| On-Account transactions      | On-Account transactions (milestones, advances, retainers) are available for both PMA and integrated projects. |
| Invoicing and Credit notes     | Project invoice proposals can be created from the project or contract list page or details page for PMA projects. |
| Invoicing Billing Rules      | Project invoice proposals can be created from the project or contract list page or details page for PMA projects. The contract is read-only, so new milestones, progress, or units of deliveries canâ€™t be enabled for invoicing. |
| Post invoices                | The existing post invoices form works for both PMA and integrated projects. |
| Multiple funding sources invoicing | PMA projects support posting invoices for multiple funding sources, but no changes can be made to the contract for funding limits, rules, or allocations. |
| Revenue Recognition          | Revenue recognition is available for both PMA and integrated projects.  |
| General journals             | General Journals can be enabled with the **Enable general journal entries for modern projects** feature, which is in preview. |

At a minimum, you must follow these steps to enable the modern architecture in a legal entity that has project data. This example follows the USSI demo data company.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you complete this procedure in a production environment, you should complete it in a sandbox environment and thoroughly test all project-related functionality.

1. Turn on the **Use the modern architecture for existing legal entities with project data** feature to remove the restriction that blocks this change in the deployment type.
2. Complete all project transactions that aren't in the list of supported transactions above. Examples of unsupported transactions include timesheets, subscription billing, and more.
3. Complete all processes that aren't in the list of processes above. Examples of unsupported processes may include post costs, accrue revenue, adjustments, and more.
4. Close any projects that are completed.
5. On the **Global project management and accounting parameters** page, select the legal entity to opt in.
6. Complete the required setup in both systems. An example of steps required for demo data company USSI are included below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After creating a new project in Dataverse, you're blocked from opting out of the legal entity being a modern project.

### Example configuration steps of enabling USSI demo data company for the modern architecture

Learn more about setup and configuration in [Project Operations Integrated with ERP deployment overview](../environment/project-operations-integrated-deployment-overview.md). For the finance and operations architecture, several areas of new setup are required. For example, you must create project categories, configure parameters, and create project cost and revenue profiles.

1. In **Data management**, navigate to **Dual write** and select **Environment details**. In the **Legal entities** tab, add a record for USSI if it isn't already present.
2. You might be prompted to run initial sync, or you can manually run the [appropriate maps](../environment/resource-dual-write-maps.md) to ensure that new data is created as required to sync master data from either system.
3. In Dataverse, navigate to **Settings** and ****Transaction Categories**. Create a new category named Services. After saving in Dataverse, you should see a category with a the name Services and a category ID starting with TCN-**.
4. In the finance and operations architecture, verify the category exists in **Transaction categories** and take note of the shared category ID, which should look like TCN-0000001000-R8D2H-1.
5. Navigate to **Project Categories** and create a new record for each of the above TCN-* categories for our financial postings.
6. Open **Project management and accounting parameters**. On the last tab for Project Operations on Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement,** ensure that the billing type defaults are mapped to determine chargeable vs nonchargeable transactions.
7. For project category defaults, use the Services category created earlier for all four transaction types.
8. Specify an account for the expense reports and procurement integration accounts.
9. In Dataverse, set up any users as bookable resources with the appropriate legal entity (USSI) and operating unit (Contoso Robotics US).

After these steps are complete, you're able to create a new project contract in USD or GBP and a USD currency-based project for Dataverse-based time and expenses and F&O expense reports.

## Enable the modern architecture of Project Operations (10.0.43)

At a minimum, you must follow these steps to enable the modern architecture in a legal entity that has project data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you complete this procedure in a production environment, you should complete it in a sandbox environment and thoroughly test all project-related functionality.

1. Turn on the **Use the modern architecture for existing legal entities with project data** feature to remove the restriction that blocks this change in the deployment type.
2. Complete all project transactions, and ensure that the following conditions are met:

    - There are no pending project transactions.
    - All invoices are completed.
    - Revenue recognition and eliminations are completed.
    - No open documents remain against a project.

3. Move all projects to a closed status.
4. On the **Global project management and accounting parameters** page, select the legal entity to opt in to.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that all project transactions are completed before you complete this step, because projects can't be reopened after you opt in to the legal entity.

5. Enable the legal entity for dual-write. Then run the [appropriate maps](../environment/resource-dual-write-maps.md) in the initial synchronization, or ensure that new data is created as required to sync master data from either system.
6. Complete the required setup in both systems. Learn more about setup and configuration in [Project Operations Integrated with ERP deployment overview](../environment/project-operations-integrated-deployment-overview.md). For the finance and operations architecture, several areas of new setup are required. For example, you must create project categories, configure parameters, and create project cost and revenue profiles.
