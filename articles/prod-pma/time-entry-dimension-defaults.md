# Defaulting financial dimensions for project time entries

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you use financial dimensions for project time entries, the default dimension value is assessed in the following order:

1. Resource
2. Project
3. Funding source

For example, if the default dimension is specified on a resource, the default value is applied over the default value that is specified for the project. Likewise, if the default dimension is specified on a project, the default value is applied over the default value that is specified for the funding source.
