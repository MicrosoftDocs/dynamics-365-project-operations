# Project Service Automation overview

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


The Project Service Automation to Finance integration solution uses the Data integration feature to synchronize data across instances of Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation via Common Data Service. The integration templates that are available with the Data integration feature enable the flow of projects, project contracts, project contract lines, project contract line milestones, project tasks, expense transaction categories, hour estimates, and expense estimates from Project Service Automation to Finance.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're using version 7.3.0, you must install KB 4074835. You will then be able to integrate fixed price projects.
> - If you're using version 7.3.0, and you are bringing fee transactions over from Project Service Automation, you must install KB 4345320 in order to include those fees in the project invoice.
> - If you're using version 8.0, you will be able to use project task integration, expense transaction categories, hour estimates, expense estimates, and functionality locking.
> - If you're using version 8.0.1 or later, you will be able to synchronize actuals.

Before you can integrate Project Service Automation Finance, you must configure the Project Service Automation integration parameters. For more information, see [Project Service Automation integration parameters](PSA-parameters.md).

This integration solution enables direct synchronization in the following scenarios:

- Maintain project contracts in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Create projects in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Maintain project contract lines in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Maintain project contract line milestones in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Maintain project tasks in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Maintain expense transaction categories in Finance, and synchronize them directly from Finance to Project Service Automation.
- Create project hour estimates in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Create project expense estimates in Project Service Automation, and synchronize them directly from Project Service Automation to Finance.
- Create project time, expense, and fee actuals in Project Service Automation, and create project transactions in the Project Service Automation integration journal so that they can be posted in Finance.
