# Allocate a project budget or budget revision across periods

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

After you enter a project budget or project budget revision, and before you submit it for approval, allocate the amounts across 
periods. If the budget or budget revision is rejected, you can also allocate the amounts before you resubmit it. 

After you allocate a budget or budget revision, review the allocation amounts and make adjustments to them before you 
submit the budget or budget revision to the approval workflow. 

1. Select **Project management and accounting** > **Common** > **Projects** > **All projects**. 
1. Select or open the project for which you want to allocate the budget or budget revision. 
1. On the Action Pane, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Budget** group, select **Project budget**. 
1. In the **Project budget** form, on the Action Pane, on the **Budget** tab, select **Allocate budget**. 
1. In the **Allocate budget** form, in the **Allocate from** and **Allocate to** fields, enter the first and last dates that you want to include 
   in the budget allocation. These dates are usually either the first and last dates of the whole project, or the first and last dates of the
   current year.  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you allocate a transaction type and approve the amounts, you can't change the allocation time period in future budget 
   > revisions. 
1. In the **By time period** field, select whether you want to allocate the project budget by year, quarter, or company fiscal periods 
   within the year.
1. Select the transaction types to allocate, and then select **Allocate**. 
1. In the **Project budget allocation** form or the **Project budget revision allocation** form, review or update the amounts that are allocated. 
1. Close the page.
1. When the allocation is the way that you want it, select **Submit** in the **Project budget** page to send the budget or budget revisions to 
    the approval workflow.
