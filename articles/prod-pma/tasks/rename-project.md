# Rename or modify a project stage

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Project stages can guide you through the project life cycle. You can define the project stages that you want to include in your projects in the **Project stage** area in the **Project management and accounting parameters** page. Dynamics 365 Finance provides five predefined project stages and three user-defined stages. You can update the name of a project stage that you're using to track the progress of projects. You can also provide names for user-defined status names. This task shows how to rename or modify a project stage and uses the USSI data set.

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Setup** > **Project management and accounting parameters**.
1. Select the **Project stage** tab.
1. In the **Language** field, select the language that you want to use for the new project stage name.
1. In the list, select the predefined or user-defined stage that you want to modify.
1. In the **Project stage** field, enter the new name.
1. Select **Save**.
