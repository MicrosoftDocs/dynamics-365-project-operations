# Project item requirements

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An item requirement is a project-specific sales order document with many benefits built-in. The item requirement is unique in giving flexibility in planning for item consumption throughout the lifecycle of a project and allows costs to be recorded much earlier than what a sales order allows.

Just like sales orders, an item requirement can represent a stocked item, a non-stocked item, or a service item. Since item requirements are integrated throughout the project module, organizations have flexibility start with planned requirements, execute against the project with using item requirements from stock or by acquiring through production or procurement, and then consume against the project at the right time. Item requirements provide great visibility into the financial implications of the transaction throughout the item's lifecycle.

Note: You can differentiate between a sales order and an item requirement by reviewing the **Order type** of the **Sales order** with values **Sales order** or **Item requirements**.

Item Requirements can be used in several project types and can be used in several project types where sales orders are not available.

Types of projects where Item Requirements and Sales Orders can be used

| Project Type     | Item Requirement | Sales Order |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Time and Material| x                 | x           |
| Fixed Price      | x                 |             |
| Investment       | x                 |             |
| Cost             |                   |             |
| Time             |                   |             |
| Internal         |                   |             |

## Creating item requirements

Item requirements can be accessed from within a Project from the **Plan** tab or from the **Item requirements** menu item under **Item tasks** within the **Project management and accounting** module.

The **Item requirements** form is a streamlined version of the **Sales order** form with required functions available in the ribbon.

Previously, item requirements were always managed through a single sales order header. This is still generally the case where where most item requirements will continue adding lines to a single header, even if all previous lines were invoiced, but in certain situations, such as with multiple funding sources there will be multiple headers created to have a unique header per funding source.

## Posting the packing slip for item requirements

When an item requirement has the packing slip posted, accounting entries are created to post the cost of the item and inventory is called to update the inventory state. 

Previously, it was not possible to cancel the packing slip of an item requirement.

### Item requirement cancellation feature

With the 10.0.33 release, it is now possible to cancel a packing slip for item requirements. The **Enable packing slip cancellation for item requirements** feature released to preview in 10.0.33 and enables cancellation for item requirements. 

The feature makes several changes including:

- Changes how financial posting is done for stocked item requirements to closely resemble sales order postings. See table 2a below for more information.
- Changes how inventory is posted for stocked items. See table 2b below.
- Changes the behavior to have the line status of stocked item requirements with a posted packing slip as **delivered** instead of **invoiced**.
- The packing slip journal can be now accessed from the item requirement form
- A new packing slip ID field has been added and the packing slip ID is visible in project posted transactions to filter the transactions and see the original transaction and reversal from the cancellation together
- Enables packing slip cancellation for item requirements that are not connected to a production order or purchase order that had their packing slip posted while the feature was enabled. Connected item requirements and packing slips that were previously posted will continue to behave as if the feature was off.
- Enforces that packing slips cannot be cancelled if the transaction was previously invoiced, or invoiced or returned through a credit note.
- Additional entries for project cost will appear in posted project transactions, but not in general ledger. The project cost is posted initially during the packing slip posting, but then is reversed and posted again during invoicing. These amounts may be the same, or it can change if inventory has determined that project cost has changed.

Additionally, the following functionality was added in the 10.0.35 release:

- Adds support for packing slip cancellation in committed costs
- Add support for packing slip cancellation in funding limits
- Adds support for adjusting transactions that have been posted with the feature on
