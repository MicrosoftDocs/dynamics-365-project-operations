This article provides information about project resourcing.

One challenge for project managers and resource managers during the project planning stage is resource allocation. They must determine and reserve the correct resource to work on a project. In Dynamics 365 Finance, resourcing capabilities for projects let you define roles that are temporary resources you can reserve for a specific engagement or part of an engagement. By using this type of resourcing, project managers and resource managers can complete the following tasks:

- Define a role that has the required competencies, so that it's easy to match resources.
- Use roles to define an initial engagement schedule that is based on reserved resources.
- Estimate costs and determine an initial budget, based on assigned roles and resources for a project.
- Use roles to estimate the number of resource reservations that are required for each engagement.
- Estimate the number of resources that are required for the whole life cycle of a project.
- Draft a work breakdown structure (WBS) by using the initial resource assignments.

As project planning proceeds, replace planned resources with staffed resources. The project manager can also update the resourcing reservations during any project stage.
