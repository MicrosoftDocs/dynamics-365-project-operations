_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Project Operations for stocked/production-based scenarios_

This article explains how to use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app to approve, reject, or delegate expense lines.

When an expense report is submitted for approval in Dynamics 365 Finance, the system adheres to preset workflow configurations. These configurations trigger the generation of work items that are assigned to the designated approvers. Approvers have the authority to review the expense reports or expense lines based on the workflow configuration, and to take the required actions based on their evaluation. These actions include approval, rejection, or delegation. Users can view attachments alongside the workflow timelines, including approval actions that other users take for the designated expenses.
