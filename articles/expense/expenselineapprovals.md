_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations for manufacturing-based scenarios_

This article explains how to use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app to approve, reject, or delegate expense lines.

When you submit an expense report for approval in Dynamics 365 Finance, the system follows the preset workflow configurations. These configurations trigger the generation of work items that the system assigns to the designated approvers. Approvers can review the expense reports or expense lines based on the workflow configuration, and take the required actions based on their evaluation. These actions include approval, rejection, or delegation. Users can view attachments alongside the workflow timelines, including approval actions that other users take for the designated expenses.
