### How do I determine whether an expense was created by the agent?

Add the **Expense Generated by** column on the web app's **Expense Reports** page.

### What should I do if I can't view the expense line for a forwarded receipt in the web app?

Processing can take 1â€“24 hours. Lines appear on reports, not in unattached expenses.

### How do I determine whether my receipt was processed?

Processed receipts are grouped into reports in the web app and shown in Teams. Errors trigger a fallback card that provides information about the failure.

### What should I do if I can't detach an expense line from a one-line adaptive card report?

The agent doesn't allow detachment of the only line on a one-line report. Use the web app to delete the report.

Ensure that the **Expense Entry feature of the Time and Expense Agent** Teams app is installed.

There is a one-day timeout. You can act on the next card or use the web app.
