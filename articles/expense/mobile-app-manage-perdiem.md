# Manage per diems by using the Expense management mobile app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for stocked and Project Operations Integrated with ERP based scenarios._

Per diem expenses refer to daily allowances that are provided to cover the expenses that employees incur while they travel for business purposes. These expenses typically include meals, lodging, and incidental expenses such as transportation and tips. Per diem rates can vary, depending on factors such as the destination, the length of the stay, and the employer's policies.

Per diem allowances simplify the reimbursement process for both employees and employers. Employees don't have to track and submit a receipt for each expense that they incur during travel. Instead, they receive a fixed daily allowance that's based on the location and duration of their trip.

## Prerequisites

To use the per diem feature in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Expense management mobile app, you must use the following versions or later of Dynamics 365 Finance together with the latest quality update (QU):

- 10.0.38 – 10.0.1777.180 or later
- 10.0.39 – 10.0.1860.99 or later

In addition, you must activate the following features:

- Expense reports re-imagined
- Per diem for expense report re-imagined interface

> [!NOTE]
> **Per diem** expense entries adhere to the **Per diem for expense report re-imagined interface** feature. Users are prevented from editing or modifying per diem expenses that are generated by using the alternative user interface (**Expense management** \> **My expenses** \> **Expense report**). For more information, see [Manage per diem using reimagined interface](per-diem-expenses.md).
