# Set up workflows for Expense management

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations Core_

You can set up a workflow process to review and approve travel and expense documents. You can define workflows for expense reports, travel requisitions, and cash advance requests.

A workflow represents a business process and defines how a document flows through the system. The workflow also indicates who must complete a task or approve a document. There are several benefits to using the workflow system in your organization:

- **Consistent processes**: You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense reports. Using the workflow system helps ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.
- **Process visibility**: You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This information helps you determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.
- **Centralized work list**: Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them.
