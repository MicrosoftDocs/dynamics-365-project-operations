_**Applies To:** Project Operations Integrated with ERP, Project Operations for stocked/production-based scenarios_

This article explains how to manage expenses, expense reports, and receipts by using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app.

## Prerequisites for using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app

Before you can perform tasks in the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app, you must work with your system administrator to ensure that the following requirements are in place:

* You must have access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance environment where you want to enter expenses.
* The **Employee** role must be assigned to your user account.
* The **Company** value must be set for your user account.
* You must be linked to an employee who has an active employment status.

## Overview of the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app UI

The user interface (UI) of the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app has four tabs:

* **Expenses** – This tab shows a list of all unattached expenses (that is, expenses that haven't been attached to an expense report.) The expenses on this tab include both manually created expenses and imported credit card transactions. You can manage the expenses (that is, create, update, or delete them). For more information about expenses, see [Manage expenses by using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app](mobile-app-manage-expenses.md).
* **Receipts** – This tab shows a list of all unattached receipts. You can switch between a **List** view and a **Tiles** view of the receipts, and manage them (that is, create, update, or delete them). For more information about receipts, see [Manage receipts by using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app](mobile-app-manage-receipts.md).
* **Reports** – This tab shows all expense reports for the employee for the selected company. The **Reports** tab is subdivided into three tabs that group the expense reports based on their status. For more information about reports, see [Manage expense reports by using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app](mobile-app-manage-expense-reports.md).
* **Approvals** – This tab shows all the expense reports and expense lines that are pending approval across all companies. It lets you approve, reject, or delegate the expense reports. For more information about approvals, see [Manage approvals by using the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app](mobile-app-manage-approvals.md).
