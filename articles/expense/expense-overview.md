_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_


Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports the ability to process expenses. Expense processing occurs with or without projects by using a customizable workflow of policies, transaction categories, and approvals.

In Project Operations, there are two supported deployment models for Expense: 

- **Full**: Full deployment is available for **Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios** or **Project Operations for production order-based scenarios**.
- **Basic**: Basic deployment is available for **Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios** and **Lite deployment â€“ deal to proforma invoicing**.

## Full 
Full Expense deployment provides a complete policy enforcement that includes the ability to create policies, such as:

  - Expense category limits
  - Travel
  - Per diem
  - Credit card imports
  - Receipt optical character recognition

## Basic 
Basic Expense deployment scenario only allows you to record basic expenses against a project. 

For more information, see [Expense entry (lite)](basic-expense.md)

## Determine your Expense deployment
To determine if you're running the Basic Expense management deployment, verify that the address URL ends with **.crm.dynamics.com**.
