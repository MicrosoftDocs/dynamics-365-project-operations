This article provides information about the new Expense mobile app. The new Expense mobile app is developed using a Microsoft Power Apps Canvas app, and it can be accessed from Power Apps mobile. The Expense mobile app is a powerful solution that is designed to simplify and enhance the expense reimbursement process and increase user productivity. With a focus on being intuitive and easy to use, the app offers a range of features that make expense reporting seamless and efficient.

Many organizations require you to attach a copy of a receipt to a travel-related or business-related expense reports that you submit for reimbursement. The Expense mobile app lets you quickly create new expense lines on your mobile device. The app uses optical character recognition (OCR) to scan an attached photo of a receipt and add the information to the expense line. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. You can also create and manage your expense reports, and then submit them for approval and reimbursement using your mobile device.

Using the Expense mobile app, you can perform the following tasks:

* Create expenses and expense reports.
* Use OCR to capture receipt pictures and extract relevant information.
* Create new, attach, detach, and delete receipts.
* Save, submit, and recall expense reports as needed.
* Customize the app to fit your organization's needs.
* Access the app from Power Apps mobile for real-time expense submission.

The Expense mobile app utilizes key configurations from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, including policy configurations, workflow configuration, and expense report fields visibility to ensure a seamless and consistent experience between the mobile app and web application.

To use the Expense mobile app, you must have a fully implemented setup of Expense management in your environment.

> [!NOTE]
