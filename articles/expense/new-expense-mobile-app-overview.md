# Expense Mobile App overview

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Project Operations for stocked/production-based scenarios_

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The functionality that's described in this article is available as part of a preview release. The functionality and the content of this article are subject to change.  For more information about preview releases, see [**One version service updates FAQ**](/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/one-version.md).

This article provides information about the new **Expense mobile app**. The new Expense mobile is developed using Power Apps Canvas App and it can be accessed from Power Apps mobile. The **Expense mobile** app is a powerful solution designed to simplify and enhance the expense reimbursement process, increasing user productivity. With a focus on intuitiveness and ease of use, the app offers a range of features that make expense reporting seamless and efficient.

Many organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a travel-related or business-related expense report that an employee submits for reimbursement. The  **Expense mobile app** lets users quickly create new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using OCR of attached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a receipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Employees can also create and manage their expense reports, and then submit them for approval and reimbursement by using their mobile device.

Specifically, the  **Expense mobile app** lets users perform these tasks:

1. Create expenses and expense reports.
2. Use OCR to capture receipt pictures and extract relevant information.
3. Receipt management, create new, attach, detach, and delete receipts.
4. Save, submit, and recall expense reports as needed.
5. Customize the app to fit your organization's needs.
6. Access the app from Power Apps mobile for real-time expense submission.

The new mobile application utilizes key configurations from Dynamics 365 Finance, including policy configurations, workflow configuration, and expense report fields visibility. This ensures a seamless and consistent experience between the mobile application and web application.

To use the app, you must have a fully implemented setup of Expense management in your environment.

> [!NOTE]
>The Expense mobile app replaces the now-deprecated [Expense Management mobile workspace](/dynamics365/project-operations/expense/expense-using-mobile.md).
