This article explains how to install and open the Expense mobile app on a mobile device. Before you can use the Expense mobile app, your administrator must install and configure the app for your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dataverse environment. For more information about installing and configuring the Expense mobile app for your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dataverse environment, see [Install and configure the Expense mobile app](new-expense-mobile-app-Install-and-configure.md).

To install and use the Expense mobile app on a mobile device, follow these steps.

1. Install the Power Apps mobile app by following the instructions in [Install the Power Apps mobile app](power-apps/mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile.md).
1. Open the Power Apps mobile app, and sign in by using the same corporate account that you use to sign in to Dynamics 365 Finance.
1. Use the **Search** field to search for "Expense Mobile." Because the Expense mobile app is a canvas app, you can add it to your favorites list in Power Apps by swiping left on it after you find it.
1. Open the Expense mobile app, and start to use it. The first time that you open the app, you must create a connection to Expense Core Service Connector by using the same corporate account that you use to sign in to Dynamics 365 Finance.
