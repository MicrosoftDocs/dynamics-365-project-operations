This article explains how to use the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app to approve, reject, or delegate expense reports.

When you submit an expense report for approval in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, the system follows preset workflow configurations. These configurations trigger the generation of work items that the system assigns to the designated approvers. Approvers can review the expense report and take the required actions, based on their evaluation. These actions include approval, rejection, or delegation. Users can view attachments alongside the workflow timelines, including approval actions that other users take for the designated expense report.
