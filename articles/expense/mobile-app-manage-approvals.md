This article explains how to use the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app to approve, reject, or delegate expense reports.

When an expense report is submitted for approval in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, the system adheres to preset workflow configurations. These configurations trigger the generation of work items that are assigned to the designated approvers. Approvers have the authority to review the expense report and take the required actions, based on their evaluation. These actions include approval, rejection, or delegation. Users can view attachments alongside the workflow timelines, including approval actions that other users take for the designated expense report.
