[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Project Operations for stocked/production-based scenarios_

This article explains how to use the Dynamics 365 expense management mobile app to manage user profile.

Users are associated with a specific legal entity, and the legal entity is automatically set as the default in their user profile for expense creation and management. In certain situations, a user may be employed in multiple legal entities, requiring expenses to be generated within the appropriate legal entity. To document an expense within a specific legal entity, users may need to adjust the legal entity setting before initiating the expense creation process..

## Change legal entity

To approve an expense report, follow these steps.

1. On your mobile device, open the **Power Apps** mobile app, and then open the **Expense management mobile** app.
1. Select the **User** on the left top of the mobile app. 
1. Select **Change legal entity** to change the current legal entity. 
1. Choose the **legal entity** for which the expense needs to be generated in the designated **selected legal entity** field.. It will show a list of the **legal entities** where the present user holds employment.
1. Click **Done** to confirm the changes.
