# Distributions on an expense report

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

When you enter expenses on an expense report, you can distribute them across multiple projects, financial dimensions, or accounts in your organization.

For example, Nancy, a Fabrikam sales representative, traveled from Copenhagen to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, Nancy met with two organizations to discuss separate projects for each organization. Nancy spent seven business days working with organization A on project A, and three business days working with organization B on project B.

Because Nancy worked on two separate projects while was in Frankfurt, when entering the expense report, Nancy distributes the expenses as appropriate for each project. The following table shows how Nancy distributed the expenses.

| Expense type | Total expense amount | Amount distributed to project A | Amount distributed to project B |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Train fare   | DKK 578              | DKK 405                         | DKK 173                         |
| Hotel        | EUR 725              | EUR 557                         | EUR 168                         |
| Meals        | EUR 346              | EUR 284                         | EUR 62                          |
