The Expense Agent brings together capabilities from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations, finance and operations apps, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Power Automate, and Dataverse to automate expense processing workflows by using AI. The feature helps save time and reduce manual effort by enabling your system to process receipts and generate expense lines and expense reports for users. It uses Microsoft Power Platform connectors for integration with Outlook, Microsoft Teams, user calendars, and the finance and operations apps environment via Dataverse virtual entities.
