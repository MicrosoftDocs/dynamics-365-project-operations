# Manage delegation

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An expense delegate can create and manage expense reports for another employee.

## Configuring expense delegation

To set up a user as an expense delegate, complete the following steps. 
1. Go to **Expense management** > **Setup** > **General** > **Delegates**. 
2. On the **Delegates** page, select **New** and then select the employee that will have a delegate defined. 
3. Enter the alias of the delegate user, and the start and end date for the delegation period.

## Manage expenses on behalf of another employee

If the feature management key **Enable expense delegates list page** is enabled, the **Expenses delegated to me** list page will be available. Go to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expenses delegated to me**.

A delegate can quickly filter and search on existing expense reports that have been delegated to them. The delegate can also quickly create a new expense report for other users by selecting **New expense report**.

Delegates can create and manage expense reports for other employees by going to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expense reports** and selecting **Open other user's expenses**.
