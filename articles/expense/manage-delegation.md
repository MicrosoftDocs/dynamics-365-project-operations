# Manage delegation

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An expense delegate can create and manage expense reports for another employee.

## Configuring expense delegation

To set up a user as an expense delegate, complete the following steps.

1. Go to **Expense management** > **Setup** > **General** > **Delegates**.
1. On the **Delegates** page, select **New** and then select the employee that you want to assign a delegate to.
1. Enter the alias of the delegate user, and the start and end date for the delegation period.

## Manage expenses on behalf of another employee

If the feature management key **Enable expense delegates list page** is enabled, the **Expenses delegated to me** list page is available. Go to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expenses delegated to me**.

A delegate can quickly filter and search on existing expense reports that are delegated to them. The delegate can also quickly create a new expense report for other users by selecting **New expense report**.

Delegates can create and manage expense reports for other employees by going to **Expense management** > **My expenses** > **Expense reports** and selecting **Open other user's expenses**.
