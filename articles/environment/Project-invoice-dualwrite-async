# Project invoice integration using Dual write Async configuration

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the Project Operations dual-write asynchronous integration for customer invoicing. The asynchronous dual-write process enables the creation of customer invoices with more than 1,000 invoice lines, overcoming the current limitation of the real-time dual-write synchronization.

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations, customer invoicing is a critical process that ensures accurate and timely billing for project-based work. Traditionally, the dual-write real-time synchronization mechanism has been used to integrate data between Dynamics 365 Finance and Dataverse. However, this real-time sync has a known limitation: it supports a maximum of 1,000 invoice lines per customer invoice.

To address this constraint, Microsoft has introduced the dual-write asynchronous (async) integration for customer invoicing. This enhancement significantly improves scalability and performance, especially for organizations dealing with high-volume, complex billing scenarios.


In Project Operations, the Project manager manages the project billing backlog and creates a proforma invoice for the customer in Microsoft Dataverse. Based on this proforma invoice, the Accounts receivable clerk or Project accountant creates a customer-facing invoice. Dual-write integration ensures that the proforma invoice details are synchronized to finance and operations apps. After the customer-facing invoice is posted, the system updates the relevant project actuals in Dataverse with the accounting detail. The following graphic provides a high-level conceptual overview of this integration.

After the Project manager confirms the proforma invoice in Dataverse, the proforma invoice header information synchronizes to finance and operations apps using the dual-write table map, **Project invoice proposal V2 (invoices)**. This is a one-way integration from Dataverse to finance and operations apps. Creating or deleting Project invoice proposals directly in finance and operations apps isn't supported.

Invoice confirmation in Dataverse also triggers the business logic to create billing-related records in the **Actuals** entity. These records are synchronized to finance and operations using the dual-write table map, **Project Operations integration actuals (msdyn\_actuals).** For more information, see [Project estimates and actuals](resource-dual-write-estimates-actuals.md). 

Project invoice proposal lines are created by the periodic process, **Import form staging**. This process is based on the billed sales actuals details in the **Actuals staging** table. For more information, see [Manage project invoice proposals](../invoicing/format-update-project-invoice-proposals.md#create-project-invoice-proposals).
