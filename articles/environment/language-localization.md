# Language Localization

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations allows for localization of the user interface (UI) and data.

> [!NOTE]
> This will only change the localization for the current user. Each user will need to change their language settings individually.

## Language Localization of the Dynamics 365 Project Operations UI
To view and change the language the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations UI is displayed in, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Settings** button ![Settings button for Dynamics 365](../media/settings-button.png "Settings button for Dynamics 365") in the upper-right corner of the screen.

2. Select **Personalization Settings**.

3. Select the **Languages** tab.

4. Here you can view and change which language to set for the Dynamics UI.

1. Select the **Settings** button ![Settings button for Dynamics 365](../media/settings-button.png "Settings button for Dynamics 365") in the upper-right corner of the screen.

2. Select **Advanced Settings**, this will open in a new tab.
