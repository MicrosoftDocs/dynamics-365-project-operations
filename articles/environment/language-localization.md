# Language Localization

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations allows for localization of the user interface (UI) and data.

> [!NOTE]
> This only changes the localization for the current user. Each user needs to change their language settings individually.

## Language Localization of the Dynamics 365 Project Operations UI

To view and change the language the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations UI is displayed in, complete the following steps.
