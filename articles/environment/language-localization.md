# Change language localization settings

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations allows for localization of the user interface (UI) and data.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes affect the localization for the current user only. Each user must change their language settings individually.

## Language localization of the Project Operations UI

To view and change the language that the Project Operations UI is shown in, follow these steps.

1. Select the **Settings** button (gear symbol).
