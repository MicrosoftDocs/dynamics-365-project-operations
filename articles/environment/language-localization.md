# Change language localization settings

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations allows for localization of the user interface (UI) and data.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes affect the localization for the current user only. Each user must change their language settings individually.

## Language localization of the Project Operations UI

To view and change the language that the Project Operations UI is shown in, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Settings** button (gear symbol).

If you want more language options to select among on the **Languages** tab, a system administrator must follow these steps:

1. Select the **Settings** button (gear symbol).
1. Select **Advanced Settings**. The advanced settings are opened on a new tab.
1. On the dropdown menu in the upper-left corner, select **Administration**.

1. In the **Language Settings** dialog box, you can add languages as options that users can select among. Users must still change their language settings individually.
