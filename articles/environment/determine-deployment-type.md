# Determine your deployment type

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you purchase the license, start here to determine the best deployment model of Dynamics 365 Project Operations using the [Guided installation flow](https://aka.ms/provisionprojectoperations).
> After you have finished the Guided installation flow, you will be directed to the correct management portal to complete your installation. See the deployment details to complete the installation.


## Existing customers of Dynamics using Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation
Project Operations includes the capabilities that shipped with Project Service Automation. An upgrade path will be released for these customers in the 2021 release wave 1.

## Existing customers of Dynamics 365 Finance using Project management and accounting 

Existing customers of Finance who use the Project management and accounting functionality can continue to use it as is. See [Project Operations for stocked/production order scenarios](#pma).


## Deployment regions
To determine which regions support Project Operations deployment, see [Geographical availability for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform report](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/geographic-availability/). Select **View Report**, and expand **Dynamics 365 > Operations Apps > Dynamics 365 Project Operations** to view the supported regions.

## Deployment types
Project Operations supports multiple deployment options to match your requirements. Whether you're a new or existing Dynamics 365 customer, Project Operations can support your needs.

Our [Deployment questionnaire](https://aka.ms/provisionprojectoperations) will help you determine the right deployment. The results will guide you toward one of the following deployment types:

- [Lite deployment â€“ deal to proforma invoicing](#lite)
- [Project Operations for resource/non-stocked scenarios](#integrated)
- [Project Operations for stocked/production order scenarios](#pma)

Project Operations support stocked/production order scenarios and non-stocked/resource-based scenarios on the same environment through legal entity-level configurations. For example, Contoso can use the stocked/production order capabilities in their US manufacturing facility (Legal entity = Contoso Manufacturing United States). Contoso can use the non-stocked/resource-based capabilities in their Contoso Robotics Arms servicing facility in UK (Legal entity = Contoso Robotics United Kingdom).
