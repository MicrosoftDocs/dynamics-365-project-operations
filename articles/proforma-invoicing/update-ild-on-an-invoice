> [!NOTE]
> Transaction Classification should not be updated on an Invoice line detail. This is because doing so, results in a mimatch between the transaction classification on the unbilled sales actual and the billed sales actual. 
In UR 55, a backend validation has beeen added to prevent this scenario. The validation will be automatically enabled on all tenants on this release.
The validation applies to all invoice line details, whether created via backing actuals or manually created invoice line details.
If there is a need to update the Transaction classification on a manually created invoice line detail, user must delete the Invoice line detail and create a new one.
