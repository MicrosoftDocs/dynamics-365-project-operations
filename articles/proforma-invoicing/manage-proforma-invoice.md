# Manage a proforma project-based invoice

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, proforma invoices are built as an extension to the invoices in Dynamics 365 Sales. However, there are many differences in the invoicing process between Sales and Project Operations when it comes to invoicing. For example, it's not possible to create a new invoice from the **Invoices List** page in Project Operations, but it is possible to do so in Sales. These differences and extensions are in place to support invoicing processes for projects that are different from a typical invoice for a sales order.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the differences, don't use invoices in Sales and Project Operations interchangeably.

## Invoice line details

Each invoice line in a project invoice includes invoice line details. These line details are related to the unbilled sales actuals and milestones that relate to the contract line referenced by the invoice line. All these transactions are marked **Ready to Invoice**.

For a **Time and Material Invoice** line, invoice line details are grouped into **Chargeable**, **Non-chargeable**, and **Complimentary** on the **Invoice Line** page. **Chargeable Invoice Line** details add up to the invoice line total. **Complimentary** and **Non-chargeable Actuals** do not add up to the invoice line total.

For a **Fixed Price Invoice** line, invoice line details are created from milestones that are marked as **Ready to invoice** on the related contract line. After the invoice line detail is created from a milestone, the billing status on the milestone updates to **Customer Invoice Created**.

## Refresh invoice transactions

If you have actuals that came in after the invoice was created, you can include these actuals on the invoice.

1. In the **Billing Backlog View**, mark the data as **Ready to Invoice**.   
2. Open the draft proforma invoice and, on the **Actions** ribbon, select **Refresh Invoice Line Transactions**.

  Invoice line details are created for any actual that is past dated and marked as **Ready to Invoice**, but isn't included on the invoice.
