# Billing Hub Overview
_**Applies To:** Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing, Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

The end to end process of invoice creation in Project Operations currently involves multiple clicks and navigation between different forms and views. 
The Billing hub experience aims to provide a rich consolidated view of contracts, contract lines, related actuals and key invoicing insights, that help accountants and billing users to create proforma invoices quickly and efficiently. By leveraging the platform's out of box nested grid functionality, users will now be able to view active contracts, respective contract lines, and the invoiceable backlog for each transaction type in a single form, eliminating the need to navigate elsewhere to review and act on these transactions.
